       "69    I was just piece of I'll share with you a piece of code Don't know if you can see much here. Yeah, I mean it's a code yeah this is the right code right so So here it is. So we've got we've got Search with channels how to stop Trello for product manager Management and here I'm going and to get I got the results and I got 10 videos with channels and description channel channel info title description and hopefully somewhere here we've got their contact information like they've got this Instagram gmail business contact that's what they shared in their in their channel Description, yeah Yeah, so maybe the easiest way would be just to first to come up with the list of like a list of user profiles and then to generate a list of their possible cures that they will be likely making on youtube and then uh parsing those channels that were created content recently with a not that huge amount of views and parse uh their contact information from those and that will be already like the list basically a list of contacts you are automatically getting a list of contacts so that the the manual part comes in the manual part is that you go and you outreach The next part is basically to set up a meeting.   \n",

       "87   There are several types of <b>engagements</b> that can occur in various contexts. In a business setting, for example, you might encounter <b>customer engagement</b>, which focuses on building relationships with customers through interactions and feedback. In the realm of social media, <b>social engagement</b> refers to how users interact with content, such as likes, shares, and comments. Additionally, there are <b>employee engagements</b>, which measure how committed and motivated employees are within an organization. Each type of engagement plays a crucial role in fostering connections and driving success in its respective area.   \n",

Yeah, I mean it's a code yeah this is the right code right so So here it is. So we've got we've got Search with channels how to stop Trello for product manager Management and here I'm going and to get I got the results and I got 10 videos with channels and description channel channel info title description and hopefully somewhere here we've got their contact information like they've got this Instagram gmail business contact that's what they shared in their in their channel Description, yeah Yeah, so maybe the easiest way would be just to first to come up with the list of like a list of user profiles and then to generate a list of their possible cures that they will be likely making on youtube and then uh parsing those channels that were created content recently with a not that huge amount of views and parse uh their contact information from those and that will be already like the list basically a list of contacts you are automatically getting a list of contacts so that the the manual part comes in the manual part is that you go and you outreach The next part is basically to set up a meeting. |\\n|  70 | 23:49            | DG         | To set up a meeting in order to talk to them.

are also thinking about what you're going to do not about like not what is the you know like you're making a car but what is the what the what the what the what is the production line right because

what do you mean the mechanics the mechanics is something that you potentially can automate or least you know what to do specifically right you open up computer you yeah you create a new tab on your browser to type in this thing and you then go and search for this and that and then you the pipeline is should be something that one need to to rely on it on the chance it's to go from A to Z right so easy a a to Z it just straightforward way of going from a to z right it is like like if you're commuting from home to every day and it's not an adventure all the time yes so what I normally do

       "69    I was just piece of I'll share with you a piece of code Don't know if you can see much here. Yeah, I mean it's a code yeah this is the right code right so So here it is. So we've got we've got Search with channels how to stop Trello for product manager Management and here I'm going and to get I got the results and I got 10 videos with channels and description channel channel info title description and hopefully somewhere here we've got their contact information like they've got this Instagram gmail business contact that's what they shared in their in their channel Description, yeah Yeah, so maybe the easiest way would be just to first to come up with the list of like a list of user profiles and then to generate a list of their possible cures that they will be likely making on youtube and then uh parsing those channels that were created content recently with a not that huge amount of views and parse uh their contact information from those and that will be already like the list basically a list of contacts you are automatically getting a list of contacts so that the the manual part comes in the manual part is that you go and you outreach The next part is basically to set up a meeting.   \n",
