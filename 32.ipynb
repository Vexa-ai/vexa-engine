And then the other one that I also recommend is RankMet Yoast. So I use this to rank that is the best one. And this one is a free plugin. So you don't need to buy anything. And this one is like to uh do your your schema markup to track the rankings so this is a really nice um nice one and this one is 100 free and i think if yeah download for free um where's the plugin and uh</td>\n",

And then the other one that I also recommend is RankMet Yoast. So I use this to rank that is the best one. And this one is a free plugin. So you don't need to buy anything. And this one is like to uh do your your schema markup to track the rankings so this is a really nice um nice one and this one is 100 free and i think if yeah download for free um where's the plugin and uh   \n",
