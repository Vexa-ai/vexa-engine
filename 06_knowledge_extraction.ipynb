    "    I now recognize myself for 4 minutes to give an opening \n",
    "statement.\n",
    "    Welcome back, Chairman Gensler. The last time you were \n",
    "before this committee, I voiced my concerns regarding your \n",
    "reckless approach to rulemaking, including the lack of a \n",
    "capital formation agenda, a crusade against the digital asset \n",
    "ecosystem, and unresponsiveness to Congress. Many things have \n",
    "changed, but so many things remain the same. Those are the same \n",
    "issues on the docket today. This means that in the last 5 \n",
    "months, you have done nothing to remedy the legitimate and \n",
    "often bipartisan concern expressed by this committee and these \n",
    "committee members, and it is disgraceful. So, let&#x27;s run through \n",
    "them again.\n",
    "    Let me be clear, Chairman Gensler, our patience is wearing \n",
    "thin. First, the Securities and Exchange Commission&#x27;s current \n",
    "approach to rulemaking jeopardizes the integrity of our \n",
    "financial markets and puts investors at risk. There is a \n",
    "critical need for comprehensive economic analysis of the rules \n",
    "you have proposed and their interaction with one another. Under \n",
    "your leadership, the Commission has failed to adequately assess \n",
    "their interplay and cumulative impact. That is shoddy work for \n",
    "an important agency and does not adhere to the SEC&#x27;s mandatory \n",
    "statutory authority.\n",
    "    While the Securities and Exchange Commission has engaged in \n",
    "a wide-ranging regulatory agenda, you seem to have overlooked \n",
    "the importance of public input, resulting in bipartisan and \n",
    "bicameral concerns.\n",
    "    First, Members on both sides of the aisle have raised valid \n",
    "concerns regarding the Markets in Financial Instruments \n",
    "Directive (MiFID) relief, swing pricing, and hard close, as \n",
    "well as your equity market structure overhaul. The Securities \n",
    "and Exchange Commission has taken no action to address these \n",
    "concerns.\n",
    "    Second, you continue to fail to prioritize capital \n",
    "formation. Among your expansive rulemaking agenda, there is not \n",
    "a single initiative aimed at improving access to capital or \n",
    "enhancing market competitiveness.\n",
    "    Third, your efforts to choke off the digital asset \n",
    "ecosystem, which has created real harm for consumers and our \n",
    "markets overall. You said the law is clear, but your actions \n",
    "have created more confusion and lasting damage. Chair Gensler, \n",
    "you have also said your goal is consumer protection, yet your \n",
    "actions have pushed legitimate digital asset activities outside \n",
    "of regulated financial institutions where consumers are best-\n",
    "protected.\n",
    "    On one hand, we have seen bipartisan votes in Congress and \n",
    "in this committee to provide clear rules of the road and real \n",
    "consumer protection, and on the other, we have seen your ad \n",
    "hoc, regulation-by-enforcement approach to digital assets on a \n",
    "losing streak in the courts. You refuse to be transparent with \n",
    "Congress regarding your interactions with FTX and Sam Bankman-\n",
    "Fried. That is the investigation we started last Congress.\n",
    "    Finally, your lack of responsiveness to this committee&#x27;s \n",
    "legitimate oversight continues to be unacceptable, and I want \n",
    "to finish here. In February, this committee made multiple \n",
    "requests for documents to the Securities and Exchange \n",
    "Commission. This is normal congressional oversight. Yet, 7 \n",
    "months later, the committee has not received a single non-\n",
    "public document that was not part of a Freedom of Information \n",
    "Act (FOIA) production. As I said, our patience is wearing thin. \n",
    "The SEC is not above the law nor is it unique. Other financial \n",
    "regulators have routinely complied with congressional \n",
    "oversight, so let me be clear: I do not want to be the first \n",
    "chairman of this committee to issue a subpoena to the \n",
    "Securities and Exchange Commission, and you should not want to \n",
    "be the first SEC Chair to receive a congressional subpoena.\n",
    "    Either we find a path forward where the SEC recognizes \n",
    "Congress as a co-equal branch of government and is responsive \n",
    "to our oversight duties, or my only option is to issue a \n",
    "subpoena. It is time for you to consider the lasting \n",
    "consequences of your actions and what that means to the \n",
    "Securities and Exchange Commission&#x27;s reputation in the long \n",
    "term. While your time in this role may be temporary, the \n",
    "repercussions for your actions may be permanent for the sgency. \n",
    "I yield back.\n",
    "    I now recognize the ranking member of the committee, Ms. \n",
    "Waters, for 4 minutes for an opening statement.\n",
    "    Ms. Waters. Good morning. The chairman just indicated that \n",
    "his patience is running thin. Mine is thinner with the opposite \n",
    "side of the aisle and the extreme MAGA Republicans who have \n",
    "taken over the House of Representatives and who are gleefully \n",
    "forcing the government of the greatest country in the world to \n",
    "shut down and forcing millions of government workers, including \n",
    "U.S. servicemembers protecting the country, to work for free or \n",
    "not at all. Likewise, in 3 days, the Securities and Exchange \n",
    "Commission, which is in charge of overseeing our $110-trillion \n",
    "capital markets, will also be shuttered. This extreme MAGA \n",
    "shutdown would cripple the SEC&#x27;s ability to stop fraud, help \n",
    "businesses raise money, or finalize rules that are critical to \n",
    "investors, but you won&#x27;t hear the Republicans today express any \n",
    "concern about the SEC or the countless businesses, workers, or \n",
    "investors that may be harmed when Republicans unilaterally \n",
    "defund Wall Street&#x27;s cop on the beat.\n",
    "    Chair Gensler, I know that you and your agency are likely \n",
    "concerned about what will happen later this week. I, too, am \n",
    "concerned. Earlier this year, we saw Fitch downgrade the U.S. \n",
    "credit rating after Republicans tried to force a default, and \n",
    "now Moody&#x27;s is also considering downgrading the U.S. rating if \n",
    "Republicans and Trump get the shutdown they so desperately \n",
    "want. I hope we can discuss today how undermining the SEC&#x27;s \n",
    "mission by furloughing 90 percent of your staff will affect \n",
    "this country and your ability to protect our markets.\n",
    "    That said, I want you to know that you are doing exactly \n",
    "the job that the American people want. Under your leadership, \n",
    "the SEC is providing investors with the information they need \n",
    "to evaluate climate change risk, you are reforming the stock \n",
    "market, which failed investors during the GameStop trading \n",
    "event, and you are working to empower investors to exercise \n",
    "their votes over companies they own.\n",
    "    I am also pleased to see that you are finalizing rules that \n",
    "will bring transparency to private funds, like private equity \n",
    "funds, and although Republicans will likely claim that the SEC \n",
    "is implementing too many rules, too quickly, the fact is that \n",
    "you are moving thoughtfully and effectively. In fact, your SEC \n",
    "has issued fewer rules than the Trump, Obama, and Bush \n",
    "Administrations at this point in their tenure, and you have \n",
    "provided twice as much time to comment than is required by law. \n",
    "The SEC is very much implementing the priorities that I and my \n",
    "Democratic colleagues championed when we were in charge and is \n",
    "shaping up to be the most pro-worker, pro-investor, and pro-\n",
    "small business SEC since FDR created the agency.\n",
    "    Chair Gensler, I appreciate that you are here today, even \n",
    "as you and your staff prepare to close the agency. I hope that \n",
    "if nothing else comes of this hearing, the American people will \n",
    "understand that this extreme MAGA Republican shutdown is the \n",
    "biggest threat to our nation&#x27;s investors, small businesses, and \n",
    "working families. My patience is wearing thinner than the \n",
    "chairman&#x27;s patience. Let&#x27;s get on with it. I yield back.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The ranking member yields back. The Chair \n",
    "now recognizes the gentlelady from Missouri, Mrs. Wagner, who \n",
    "is also the Chair of our Subcommittee on Capital Markets, for 1 \n",
    "minute.\n",
    "    Mrs. Wagner. Thank you, Chairman McHenry. Yes, let&#x27;s get on \n",
    "with it. The SEC&#x27;s mission is to protect investors; maintain \n",
    "fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and to facilitate capital \n",
    "formation. Unfortunately, your leadership has undermined these \n",
    "core objectives, sir. None of the 50-odd proposals that your \n",
    "SEC has proposed promote capital formation. Instead, the focus \n",
    "has shifted towards imposing costly regulatory and disclosure \n",
    "requirements, and equally troubling, potential violations of \n",
    "the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), as recent SEC proposals \n",
    "lack a comprehensive analysis of market dynamics and their \n",
    "consequences, especially for SEC rules that have been changed.\n",
    "    Here is the way forward, sir: one, begin with a robust \n",
    "engagement with market participants to shape your thinking \n",
    "before proposing rules; two, conduct investor testing; three, \n",
    "conduct economic analysis looking not just at the individual, \n",
    "but the cumulative; and four, do not ignore Congress when we \n",
    "send bipartisan letters expressing concerns about detrimental \n",
    "effects of the proposals. We need market integrity. I yield \n",
    "back.\n",

    "than your recent predecessors. You are generally right, we \n",

    "\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Good morning, Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member \n",
    "Waters, and members of the committee. Thank you for inviting me \n",
    "here today. As is customary, I would like to note that my views \n",
    "are my own as the Chair of the SEC, and I am not speaking on \n",
    "behalf of my fellow Commissioners or the SEC staff.\n",
    "    For 90 years, the Federal securities laws and our work to \n",
    "oversee them have played a crucial role for the public both in \n",
    "good times and in stress times. The core principles of the U.S. \n",
    "securities markets regulation have contributed to America&#x27;s \n",
    "economic success and geopolitical standing. At this remarkable \n",
    "agency, we serve investors building for a better future and \n",
    "issuers raising money to fund innovation, while overseeing the \n",
    "$100-trillion capital markets where investors and issuers meet. \n",
    "The essence of this is captured in our three-part mission: \n",
    "protecting investors; maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient \n",
    "markets in the middle; and facilitating capital formation, as \n",
    "Chairwoman Wagner mentioned earlier and Chairman McHenry.\n",
    "    The SEC is the cop on the beat watching out for \n",
    "constituents. The dedicated staff of the agency does an \n",
    "extraordinary job with limited resources. America is blessed \n",
    "with the largest, most sophisticated, and most innovative \n",
    "capital markets in the world, but we cannot take this for \n",
    "granted. Even a gold medalist must keep training. That is why \n",
    "we are updating our rules for the technology and business \n",
    "models of the 2020s. My written testimony details those \n",
    "efforts, and I am sure I will get questions on this rule or \n",
    "that rule, but I would like to just point out, overall, a \n",
    "context.\n",
    "    We are updating our rules to promote the efficiency, \n",
    "integrity, and resiliency of the markets in the middle, and \n",
    "that helps capital formation on one side, and investors on the \n",
    "other. And we do so with an eye on those investors and issuers \n",
    "and making sure the markets work for them rather than issuers \n",
    "and investors working for Wall Street and the markets in the \n",
    "middle.\n",
    "    We are working to help lower costs, increase access, and \n",
    "promote financial stability, and each of the proposals we have \n",
    "made in the last 2 years further this three-part mission, given \n",
    "the authorities granted by Congress, and our Division of \n",
    "Economic and Risk Analysis provides robust economic analysis, \n",
    "which considers the cost and benefits as well as effects on \n",
    "efficiency, competition, and capital formation as Congress \n",
    "mandated. We greatly benefit also from public input regarding \n",
    "economics.\n",
    "    The policies themselves are legal authorities, and we get \n",
    "that feedback. And in the last 2 years, we provided the public \n",
    "ample time to comment, with an average of 70 days to comment \n",
    "from the time the proposal is published. And since January of \n",
    "last year, 2022, we have always had a minimum of 60 days from \n",
    "when it is on our website, and sometimes as long as 100 days. \n",
    "When comment periods close, we often continue to get additional \n",
    "comments through meetings and otherwise, which staff has \n",
    "considered as well, including really helpful letters from \n",
    "members of this committee.\n",
    "    Based on the public feedback, the staff and the Commission \n",
    "consider possible adjustments to the proposals and whether it \n",
    "is appropriate to move forward with the final rule. This \n",
    "process normally takes 12 to 24 months, and we move to adopt \n",
    "rules only when the staff and the Commission think they are \n",
    "ready to be considered. We are focused on getting it right \n",
    "based upon the economics, and the authorities promoting the \n",
    "mission, not against the clock. The SEC now has issued \n",
    "proposals for most of that unified agenda 2 years ago. We \n",
    "finalized 24 rulemakings, nearly all of which have changed from \n",
    "the proposals based on the public feedback, including from \n",
    "members of this committee. I am grateful to work alongside a \n",
    "remarkable staff and fellow Commissioners to promote \n",
    "efficiency, integrity, and resiliency.\n",
    "    With the possibility of a government shutdown, I would \n",
    "note, as you are our oversight committee, that we would be down \n",
    "to a small, skeleton staff, about 7 to 8 percent of our staff, \n",
    "with everybody else being furloughed. Normal oversight of the \n",
    "markets, given this, will not be possible in the SEC during the \n",
    "pendency of a shutdown, so we look forward to the day when we \n",
    "can get back to work, hopefully, and fulfill our mission in \n",
    "support of the public. Thank you.\n",

    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman yields back. I will now \n",
    "recognize myself for 5 minutes for questions.\n",
    "    Chair Gensler, the last time we were here, I asked you \n",
    "about Ether. In 2018, you said that Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, \n",
    "and Bitcoin cash were not securities, so I want to focus today \n",
    "on Bitcoin. Why do you believe bitcoin is not a security?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I think you are \n",
    "referencing remarks I made as a professor at MIT. And as I \n",
    "wrote in that paper, at that time, it was really about \n",
    "something called the Howey Test. And the Supreme Court, as the \n",
    "law of the land, talks about if the public is anticipating a \n",
    "profit based on the efforts of others. And I think I noted in \n",
    "that paper back in 2018 that I didn&#x27;t see that Bitcoin met that \n",
    "standard.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. But your review on Bitcoin--you have made \n",
    "comments that you believe Bitcoin is not a security. Is that \n",
    "true?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I think the staff of the SEC have also and the \n",
    "prior Chair----\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. I am just asking you this question, and \n",
    "this is not a, ``gotcha.&#x27;&#x27; I thought this was going to be an \n",
    "easy softball into harder questions. Do you think Bitcoin is a \n",
    "security?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I think I have said in the past that I think \n",
    "that----\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. I am asking you to answer my question \n",
    "now. This is not supposed to be hard.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I know. I said it does not meet the Howey \n",
    "Test, which is the law of the land about being an investment--\n",
    "--\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. It doesn&#x27;t meet the Howey Test, so, \n",
    "therefore, it is a commodity. Is that fair?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I would say it is not a security, and the test \n",
    "is otherwise for other laws.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission \n",
    "(CFTC) says they don&#x27;t have the authority over Bitcoin and \n",
    "digital commodities. Do you think legislation is necessary to \n",
    "protect consumers in the world of digital assets, in \n",
    "particular, given that gap around just Bitcoin?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I think as I have testified here in this \n",
    "committee room 4 years ago as a private citizen, that for the \n",
    "parts of the crypto ecosystem that are not securities under the \n",
    "Commodity Exchange Act, the CFTC has some anti-fraud \n",
    "authorities. They don&#x27;t have what is called plenary authority \n",
    "to write rules around that, and as I have said in the past--I \n",
    "have been supportive of our sister agency, if I can say that, \n",
    "an agency that I once was honored to chair and I liked quite a \n",
    "bit--doesn&#x27;t have that plenary authority. And if Congress moves \n",
    "forward, that can help them.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. So, the spot market lacks a regulatory \n",
    "paradigm and established law? Should we take action there?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I&#x27;m sorry. I am not sure I follow. The U.S. \n",
    "stock market, you are talking about the securities market?\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. No, the CFTC. I am continuing with your \n",
    "answer. My follow-up there was because there is not a \n",
    "regulatory remit. The Congress has given them clear regulatory \n",
    "remit. We should step in--let me just move on. I have talked \n",
    "about your noncompliance with document requests made by this \n",
    "committee. You believe the Commission must vote in order to \n",
    "produce nonpublic information to this committee, do you not?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Under the Exchange Act, I do believe that the \n",
    "Commission needs that vote.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. Okay. Have you scheduled the vote \n",
    "necessary to provide the non-public documents to this \n",
    "committee?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We, I think, have been working with your staff \n",
    "and believe in the oversight of this committee. We have \n",
    "provided somewhere over 40,000 payments documents.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. Yes. As I said in my opening statement, \n",
    "you did not provide anything that was nonpublic. In fact, you \n",
    "produced one of the letters that we wrote to you as a \n",
    "responsive document, which shows the absurdity of it.\n",
    "    So, the General Counsel&#x27;s office has indicated to my staff \n",
    "that after a 10-week review process, these documents are ready \n",
    "to be transmitted. It just needs a vote. When do you intend to \n",
    "schedule that vote?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We continue to work with you and your staff. \n",
    "The Commission has approved that some senior staff will be \n",
    "taking transcribed interviews, I think, with your staff and \n",
    "we----\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. But that is not responsive to my document \n",
    "request. This should not be the hard work of a chairman to \n",
    "answer these questions. You have 30 major rulemakings, but you \n",
    "won&#x27;t even provide basic documents to us. Your unresponsiveness \n",
    "is noncompliance, and we will have to take action if you are \n",
    "not willing to comply. You have a 10-week review process, and \n",
    "you have not provided documents. Furthermore, you haven&#x27;t even \n",
    "done the economic analysis of your interplay of these major \n",
    "rulemakings that are going to affect anybody who owns a stock, \n",
    "bond, or any type of security.\n",
    "    So, you have serious questions to answer to the public and \n",
    "to Congress, and we intend to get your compliance. We can do it \n",
    "the easy way or the hard way.\n",
    "    And with that, I yield back. The ranking member is now \n",
    "recognized for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Ms. Waters. Thank you very much. There are a number of \n",
    "questions that I would like to ask, but since we started out on \n",
    "Bitcoin, let&#x27;s go further into crypto. Chair Gensler, I have \n",
    "heard you often say there is mass noncompliance by crypto firms \n",
    "in the marketplace today. I am very concerned with what sounds \n",
    "like gross violations of the law that end in investors getting \n",
    "ripped off. The failures and fraud of crypto firms like Terra \n",
    "Luna, for example, cost investors as much as $60 billion, which \n",
    "was larger than the Madoff Ponzi scheme in 2008. I know that \n",
    "the SEC has brought enforcement actions against Sam Bankman-\n",
    "Fried and FTX, the failure of which caused investors $9 \n",
    "billion.\n",
    "    Since we are talking about everything today, can you please \n",
    "describe the actions that the SEC has taken to shut down crypto \n",
    "firms and recover funds of our harmed investors? How much in \n",
    "penalties have defendants paid, in cases you have set up? Are \n",
    "crypto firms getting the message?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Thank you. I do share your concerns that this \n",
    "is a field that is rife with fraud and manipulation and scams, \n",
    "and the American public is still getting hurt by the \n",
    "noncompliance in this field. In terms of the SEC&#x27;s approach, it \n",
    "is through both policy and rulemaking, and, yes, enforcement. \n",
    "The SEC had finalized rules with regard to Special Purpose \n",
    "Broker-Dealers (SPBDs) in crypto, and we also addressed \n",
    "questions that came up about crypto exchanges, the custody of \n",
    "crypto in a custody rule that I imagine we will chat a little \n",
    "bit about later today, and even best execution. But \n",
    "unfortunately, as you noted, we have brought numerous cases in \n",
    "this field to try to protect the American public and be a cop \n",
    "on the beat with regard to so many of these schemes.\n",
    "    Ms. Waters. Thank you very much. I just wanted to make sure \n",
    "that the opposite side of the aisle, who protects too often, in \n",
    "too many different ways, crypto firms, knows what you are \n",
    "doing.\n",
    "    Let me move on. I am going to ask a few questions about the \n",
    "impact of the government shutdown on the SEC&#x27;s operation. Chair \n",
    "Gensler, approximately how many people work at the agency, and \n",
    "what percentage will be furloughed during a government \n",
    "shutdown?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We have just under 5,000 employees, and \n",
    "probably 92 or 93 percent will be furloughed, so we will be \n",
    "down to a skeleton staff.\n",
    "    Ms. Waters. Which divisions would most be impacted, and \n",
    "describe for us what these divisions do?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It is really across the whole agency, but the \n",
    "bulk of our workforce is in examinations and enforcement and \n",
    "disclosure review, but let me say what the public won&#x27;t have: \n",
    "They won&#x27;t have somebody really at full force overseeing the \n",
    "market. For companies that want to go public, we won&#x27;t be able \n",
    "to really review the documents or what is called documents \n",
    "going effective if you want to do an initial public offering \n",
    "(IPO), which is so critical to capital formation. I want to say \n",
    "this for the public. We will keep open our tips, complaint, and \n",
    "referral lines, and we will keep open comment files so people \n",
    "can still submit comments on our rulemakings and the like, but \n",
    "we won&#x27;t really have individuals behind the scenes to follow \n",
    "up, except for a skeleton staff.\n",
    "    Ms. Waters. I, too, am worried about public offerings. I \n",
    "have worked with the opposite side of the aisle to improve the \n",
    "ability of those who want to do IPOs, but as you explain it, \n",
    "this will have a negative impact, this shut down, on the \n",
    "ability of IPOs to be initiated. Is that correct?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I think that is just a practical reality, yes.\n",
    "    Ms. Waters. What happens if a whistleblower comes to the \n",
    "Commission with urgent information that could protect \n",
    "investors? Would there be staff to process this? Could the \n",
    "Commission deploy resources in response to this information?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Although we will be able to do intakes, there \n",
    "won&#x27;t be the usual investigative force of individuals to follow \n",
    "up as readily unless it is an emergency and it is specifically \n",
    "about protection of property.\n",
    "    Ms. Waters. What will happen if there is a major disruption \n",
    "in the capital markets&#x27; operations and infrastructure during \n",
    "this shutdown? Could the SEC be there to respond?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It is a very good question. If there were \n",
    "market events, as you say, senior leadership would be there, \n",
    "but again, we would be down to a skeleton staff.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentlelady&#x27;s time has expired.\n",
    "    Ms. Waters. Thank you.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. I will now go to the Vice Chair of the \n",
    "committee, Mr. Hill of Arkansas, for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Hill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Gensler, it is good \n",
    "to have you here. I want to start out today and talk about \n",
    "equity market structure as a topic. Just yesterday, Congressman \n",
    "Foster and I sent you a letter signed by 16 Democrats and 16 \n",
    "Republicans to express our concerns about the equity market \n",
    "structure proposals that the Commission has initiated. The \n",
    "letter urges you, quite simply, to stop your rulemaking on that \n",
    "broad set of proposals until you finalize the trade execution \n",
    "data rule, the so-called Rule 605, and that that be done first \n",
    "so that you can rely on that data for an appropriate \n",
    "rulemaking.\n",
    "    And this speaks to Chairman McHenry&#x27;s point about the \n",
    "interplay between the rules, which, contrary to the ranking \n",
    "member, I think there are 50 pending proposals. Many of them \n",
    "interact. They are confusing and sometimes in conflict with \n",
    "each other, and I think this is a classic example. And I think \n",
    "it is particularly true where you are failing to do a rigorous \n",
    "cost-benefit analysis for many of the rules. For instance, the \n",
    "SEC&#x27;s dealer proposal, which uses the word, ``uncertain,&#x27;&#x27; 15 \n",
    "times to describe its impact on efficiency and competition for \n",
    "the most important financial market in the world: U.S. \n",
    "Treasuries.\n",
    "    So, Chairman Gensler, I would just say that this is not \n",
    "MAGA Republicans who are sending you a critical letter of \n",
    "concern, it is a very bipartisan view, and 32 Members of this \n",
    "body that think the SEC should reconsider. Would you wait for \n",
    "the Rule 605 data before you finish the other equity market \n",
    "proposals?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I thank you for the letter. I did read it last \n",
    "night around 9:30 when it came in, and it is part of our \n",
    "comment file, and we will take it and think of it very \n",
    "seriously. But I would say, in terms of the equity markets, the \n",
    "rules have largely not been updated since 2000.\n",
    "    Mr. Hill. That may be, but that means that we need to do it \n",
    "in a comprehensive way, in an interoperative way to make sure \n",
    "we have the right data. So, I will take it that your short \n",
    "answer is, no, that it is a comment, but I really urge you to \n",
    "get these equity markets&#x27; proposals in order and to rely on \n",
    "data and not just emotion or one memes talk event to make \n",
    "policy.\n",
    "    Let me change subjects. Let me talk about my favorite kitty \n",
    "cat, which is the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT). For over a \n",
    "decade, this bad idea has been floating around the Commission \n",
    "since the flash crash in 2010, to collect and store private, \n",
    "personal information on every American, and every American with \n",
    "a brokerage account, and every broker-dealer. In my view, this \n",
    "is massive overkill. This is an unnecessary invasion of \n",
    "privacy. This is a massive new tax on the brokerage accounts of \n",
    "individual American citizens. And maybe worst of all, \n",
    "considering the 9 years I have been here, this is another \n",
    "massive, centralized government database that is going to be \n",
    "hacked, like the IRS, like the CFPB, and like OPM. I have real \n",
    "concerns about it, and I expressed those concerns to previous \n",
    "SEC Chairs Mary Jo White and Jay Clayton, and now to you. In \n",
    "fact, you inherited this albatross. Why don&#x27;t you just bury it \n",
    "and say that we are not going to do the CAT?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I not only inherited that from them, but I \n",
    "inherited from my dad, a real allergy to cats, and it is \n",
    "really----\n",
    "    Mr. Hill. Oh my god.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Oh my god.\n",
    "    Mr. Hill. Yes, but we don&#x27;t have time for that. I am \n",
    "reclaiming my time. We can do the kitty part later. Do you know \n",
    "what a targeted exam letter is by the Financial Industry \n",
    "Regulatory Authority (FINRA)? Do you know what that is?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I am familiar with exam letters.\n",
    "    Mr. Hill. Yes, and do you know what a Blue Sheet is?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Sure, I am generally familiar--I don&#x27;t know \n",
    "where you are headed, but I am generally familiar with it.\n",
    "    Mr. Hill. And you know that all of our markets have \n",
    "regular, daily, inter-day, and overnight global market \n",
    "surveillance on trading, right? That is a general feature of \n",
    "all of our self-regulatory organizations (SROs), right? Do you \n",
    "agree with that?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. SROs are responsible to do that, sir.\n",
    "    Mr. Hill. Yes, I understand that, and you regulate the \n",
    "SROs. So what I am suggesting to you is, there is no \n",
    "justification for capturing all of these trades when you have, \n",
    "right now, market surveillance data available to your \n",
    "Enforcement Division. And you can right now do a sweep exam \n",
    "through a Blue Sheet, which is where you go to large traders \n",
    "and you look at everybody who traded in Apple, you can get all \n",
    "the personally identifiable information (PII) you want because \n",
    "you have a probable cause for doing that, and that is why CAT, \n",
    "I think, exceeds what you should be doing. Why is the Blue \n",
    "Sheet targeted exam process inadequate for you to do your job?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I think you raise a good question, but the \n",
    "Consolidated Audit Trail gives the self-regulatory \n",
    "organizations and the SEC a look at those orders and matches up \n",
    "sometimes across.\n",
    "    Mr. Hill. They have the ability to do that now. They don&#x27;t \n",
    "need to capture every trade in every retail brokerage account \n",
    "in America. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman yields back. I will now \n",
    "recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, who is \n",
    "also the ranking member of our Capital Markets Subcommittee.\n",
    "    Mr. Sherman. As the chairman points out, it is about \n",
    "capital formation. You are at the nerve center of the world&#x27;s \n",
    "capitalist system, where capital is deployed to the operating \n",
    "businesses. If we have a shutdown of the government, I think it \n",
    "has already been pointed out by the ranking member that we will \n",
    "stop all IPOs in their tracks. Does this also apply to \n",
    "companies that are already public but are issuing additional \n",
    "shares, and would this also apply to new bond issuances?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I would be glad to follow up and have staff \n",
    "chat with you. It is more nuanced. It really depends on whether \n",
    "they have filings that they can----\n",
    "    Mr. Sherman. So, a few of them are sophisticated----\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Many public companies would be foreclosed from \n",
    "doing additional offerings. Others would be allowed. It really \n",
    "depends on the nature of their filings.\n",
    "    Mr. Sherman. So, a huge portion of our $100-trillion \n",
    "capital markets would not be available to raise additional \n",
    "capital, or a huge portion of the initial capital that would be \n",
    "raised for operating businesses would be blocked. We also, as I \n",
    "understand it, as far as providing assurance for the honesty of \n",
    "markets, you would continue to collect emails as they come in, \n",
    "but you won&#x27;t be doing any investigations or opening any \n",
    "additional investigatory files, correct?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It is really prescribed and narrow. It relates \n",
    "to a 19th Century law called the Energy Efficiency Act, but we \n",
    "can protect public property, but it is really----\n",
    "    Mr. Sherman. Okay. So, nobody is going to be stealing your \n",
    "computers, but it is going to be the Wild West on Wall Street, \n",
    "all while we are fighting for capital with other countries and \n",
    "other capital market systems and we put up a sign that says, \n",
    "``closed.&#x27;&#x27; I can&#x27;t think of a worse thing we could do to \n",
    "American capitalism.\n",
    "    Next, I don&#x27;t think swing pricing achieves its purpose. We \n",
    "should want people to invest in mutual funds and diversify and \n",
    "invest in America. But the swing pricing rule you have put \n",
    "forward has been criticized by a letter signed by the vast \n",
    "majority of Democrats on our Capital Markets Subcommittee, and \n",
    "many Republicans, I think the vast majority, as well as the \n",
    "Consumer Federation of America. It seems to be an unfair rule \n",
    "in that giant players can participate in collective investment \n",
    "trusts (CITs) rather than mutual funds, get the same benefits, \n",
    "and not be subject to this rule. Investors will be told, you \n",
    "may not get your net asset value. People who live in the \n",
    "Pacific Time Zone are disadvantaged. Any chance you will be \n",
    "taking this rule back to the drawing board?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We have a lot of comments. I am very familiar \n",
    "with the letter that you and Representative Wagner co-authored. \n",
    "It is really going at a core feature that when you have a \n",
    "mutual fund, if you redeem that mutual fund, you should redeem \n",
    "at the right price so that the remaining shareholders don&#x27;t get \n",
    "dilution. It works well in normal times, and less well in \n",
    "stress times, but we are taking all of that into consideration.\n",
    "    Mr. Sherman. I understand. I will simply point out that for \n",
    "many years, thousands of mutual funds, all competing for \n",
    "capital, could have adopted this rule, and not a single one of \n",
    "them thought, oh, this is what investors want. This is what \n",
    "will seem fair to investors. You have the safeguarding rule. I \n",
    "will simply comment that I think we need a safeguarding rule \n",
    "for intangible assets. I would hope if you feel tangible assets \n",
    "such as real estate need a safeguarding rule, that you would \n",
    "write a separate rule. Is the safeguarding rule that you are \n",
    "writing pretty much structured around the intangible assets, \n",
    "such as crypto?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. No. Its genesis came from Congress itself as \n",
    "part of the Dodd-Frank Act 12, 13 years ago. There was a new \n",
    "provision that the SEC address the custody of all customer \n",
    "assets by investment advisers, so it expanded it from just \n",
    "funds and securities to all assets. That was the genesis of \n",
    "this.\n",
    "    Mr. Sherman. I would hope that the rule would have separate \n",
    "sections and a completely different approach for real estate on \n",
    "the one hand and crypto on the other. In real estate, the title \n",
    "is public, and the asset isn&#x27;t moving anywhere, and intangible \n",
    "assets and crypto are very different. I believe my time has \n",
    "expired.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It does have separate sections, but we will \n",
    "take that under advisement, and it is so good to see \n",
    "Representative----\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. We will \n",
    "now recognize the gentleman from Oklahoma making his valiant \n",
    "return after tussling with a bull. We&#x27;re happy to have you \n",
    "back, Frank.\n",
    "    [applause]\n",
    "    Mr. Lucas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I very much \n",
    "appreciate that. And I would note to my colleagues, it has been \n",
    "a long time since I have sat this far down in the committee \n",
    "hearing.\n",
    "    [laughter]\n",
    "    Mr. Lucas. But after my interaction with a 1,000-pound \n",
    "bull, I am just happy to be here. So with that, thank you.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. I ask unanimous consent to restore the \n",
    "gentleman&#x27;s time. We are happy to have you back, Frank.\n",
    "    Mr. Lucas. Thank you.\n",
    "    Before I begin my questions, I would like to reiterate a \n",
    "few points made in the bipartisan letter that I sent regarding \n",
    "the SEC&#x27;s two proposed rulemakings on security-based swaps and \n",
    "security loans, and I would like to enter that letter into the \n",
    "record, Mr. Chairman.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n",
    "    Mr. Lucas. These proposals, I believe, could impair market \n",
    "liquidity while increasing risks and costs. And to avoid \n",
    "unintended negative consequences, the SEC should study the data \n",
    "for regulatory purposes before moving forward with public \n",
    "dissemination. This is consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act, and \n",
    "I hope the Commission will give serious consideration to this \n",
    "approach.\n",
    "    Now, Chairman Gensler, I would like to focus on the \n",
    "proposed rule branded as the safeguarding advisery client \n",
    "assets. The proposed rule would impose requirements that are \n",
    "inconsistent with the CFTC rules--and you have spent a good bit \n",
    "of time working on CFTC rules in your past life--and would \n",
    "indirectly give the SEC, I fear, authority over the CFTC&#x27;s \n",
    "regulated markets. And in addition to being outside of the \n",
    "SEC&#x27;s authority, this would create significant problems, I \n",
    "think, across the entire financial markets. Have you consulted \n",
    "with the CFTC on the impact of the proposed rule, and if so, \n",
    "for curiosity, what was their feedback?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. First, Representative Lucas, it is so good to \n",
    "see you, and your letter with regard to securities-based swaps \n",
    "not only gained my attention, but there are many people at the \n",
    "SEC who would say, this is Representative Lucas&#x27; letter, will \n",
    "you please take a close look at it.\n",
    "    Mr. Lucas. Thank you.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. But on your topic and your question about \n",
    "safeguarding of assets, the staff has consulted with fellow \n",
    "regulators at the CFTC about that safeguarding rule, and taken \n",
    "their thoughts into consideration. We are some time away. This \n",
    "was only proposed earlier this year, and it usually takes 12 to \n",
    "24 months before we even consider adoption, but I think that \n",
    "there are paths forward in terms of the intersection between \n",
    "their Rule 1.25 and these custody rules.\n",
    "    Mr. Lucas. I just think it is imperative that the SEC \n",
    "refrain from applying the proposal to CFTC-regulated markets. \n",
    "And I hope that you will be able to commit to that, even if it \n",
    "means perhaps at some point withdrawing the rule entirely.\n",
    "    Now, second question. The Commission has also recently \n",
    "proposed a rule regarding the use of predictive data analytics \n",
    "used by broker-dealers and investment advisers. The proposed \n",
    "rule cast a broad net over what is considered a covered \n",
    "technology: ``A covered technology is defined as an analytical, \n",
    "technological, computational function, an algorithm, model, a \n",
    "correlation matrix, or similar method or process that \n",
    "optimizes, predicts, guides, forecast, or directs investment-\n",
    "related behaviors or outcomes.&#x27;&#x27; What a mouthful. The included \n",
    "economic analysis explains that the rule would require \n",
    "substantial resources to comply with and would prevent smaller \n",
    "firms from entering the market or adopting new technology at \n",
    "all.\n",
    "    So, Chair Gensler, could you clarify what technologies are \n",
    "covered, and is the intent of the rule to make it difficult for \n",
    "firms to employ certain kinds of technology?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. The intent of Rule A is to be technology-\n",
    "neutral, and one really core thing is that when investment \n",
    "advisers or broker-dealers interact with investors, that \n",
    "interaction that if they are using, as you said, a covered \n",
    "technology for predictive data analytics, that they continue to \n",
    "put the investors&#x27; interests ahead of their own, and not the \n",
    "reverse, putting the investment advisers&#x27; interests ahead of \n",
    "the investing public. That is the core of this proposal.\n",
    "    Mr. Lucas. I would simply add that given the rapid advances \n",
    "in machine learning and generative artificial intelligence \n",
    "(AI), the United States should lead the way in the development \n",
    "of innovative technologies that would unlock new economic \n",
    "opportunities. And we should be careful not to be so hostile to \n",
    "new technologies that we stop innovation in its tracks.\n",
    "    With that, I will simply say thank you, Chairman Gensler. \n",
    "And Chairman McHenry, I spent 7 weeks being calm and at home. I \n",
    "have not been that calm and that long at home since 1986, so I \n",
    "am happy to be back with all of you, and with you, Mr. \n",
    "Chairman. I yield back.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. Well, Frank, we are happy to have you \n",
    "back and as a current Chair of one committee, and a former \n",
    "Chair of another committee, we honor the old bulls.\n",
    "    Mr. Lucas. And I missed the ranking member, too.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. I will now recognize Mr. Meeks of New \n",
    "York for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Meeks. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Chairman \n",
    "Gensler, for appearing before us today.\n",
    "    Over the course of the last few months, I have had the \n",
    "opportunity to ask both the SEC&#x27;s Director of the Division of \n",
    "Economic and Risk Analysis, and the Director of the Division of \n",
    "Investment Management about the private funds rules. In \n",
    "particular, I am asking about revisiting the economic analysis \n",
    "to ensure that it adequately considered the disparate impact on \n",
    "emerging minority- and women-owned asset management firms, \n",
    "minority- and women-owned businesses, and historically-\n",
    "underinvested communities. Dr. Wachter assured me that the SEC \n",
    "shared my concerns, and Director Birdthistle testified that the \n",
    "economic impact analysis was expanded to look into these \n",
    "concerns.\n",
    "    So my question to you is, one, can you confirm that the \n",
    "economic analysis was expanded, and if so, can you speak to the \n",
    "specific changes that were made in response to the findings \n",
    "from that expanded analysis?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. The rule, as other rules do, considers the \n",
    "effect on small businesses. And in this rule particularly, the \n",
    "economic analysis looked at small businesses, including those \n",
    "that are women-owned and minority-owned investment advisers \n",
    "running private funds.\n",
    "    Mr. Meeks. I would like to follow up on that, but I have so \n",
    "many questions I want to ask you because it is really important \n",
    "to get more details of what those findings were. But I will ask \n",
    "you more about that in writing and get a response because I \n",
    "want to shift to a related issue that I find to be disturbing.\n",
    "    On page 553 of the private fund rules, the Commission seems \n",
    "to seriously suggest that smaller investment advisers, whom we \n",
    "know are likely to be predominantly minority- and women-owned, \n",
    "consider reducing their assets under management to avoid \n",
    "registering with the SEC to help mitigate the impact of the \n",
    "rule to them. Now, Mr. Gensler, we know that minority-owned \n",
    "firms are 3 to 4 times more likely to fund minority enterprises \n",
    "and their portfolio companies. So wouldn&#x27;t telling these firms \n",
    "to stifle their own growth perpetuate the lack of diverse \n",
    "representation in the industry and, therefore, decrease the \n",
    "amount of funding going to diverse entrepreneurs?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. As the economic analysis noted and you just \n",
    "read, there are often some firms, whether it is in a rule like \n",
    "this or other rules, that are right at a cutoff point where \n",
    "they might be registered and regulated, that they might make \n",
    "different choices. But overall, this rule is actually really \n",
    "helpful because it promotes competition and transparency. The \n",
    "biggest fund managers would have to provide greater \n",
    "transparency to their investors. And the smaller asset managers \n",
    "can actually benefit from that greater transparency and \n",
    "competition around the side letters that they might be cutting \n",
    "with large asset pension funds and the like.\n",
    "    So, it is really a balancing of these economic \n",
    "considerations. It was pro-capital formation, it was pro-\n",
    "investor because it promotes transparency in the middle of the \n",
    "market, that asset managers would have transparency about their \n",
    "fees, their performance, and the so-called side letters that \n",
    "they enter into.\n",
    "    Mr. Meeks. I just have problems with it because it seems to \n",
    "me, again, you are telling these asset managers to not grow, to \n",
    "not continue to build where they can do more because of the \n",
    "people that they serve, so it is an issue for me, which I will \n",
    "follow up on.\n",
    "    Under your leadership, the SEC has been incredibly active, \n",
    "and I will leave it to others to discuss the pace and the \n",
    "breadth of the Commission&#x27;s rulemakings. But what I wonder is \n",
    "whether or not the SEC considers how their proposed rules will \n",
    "interact with existing and draft rules during the rulemaking \n",
    "process, particularly when it comes to the economic impact of \n",
    "the finalized and pending rules, and do you think there would \n",
    "be any value to doing a holistic analysis?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We do in each economic analysis, which often \n",
    "runs between 100 and 250 pages. Each of those considers other \n",
    "rules that may have been adopted and adjusts the baseline in \n",
    "each of those analyses.\n",
    "    Mr. Meeks. I yield back.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. I will now recognize the gentleman from \n",
    "Texas, Mr. Sessions, for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Sessions. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, and I \n",
    "appreciate the gentleman, my friend, Mr. Meeks, for his \n",
    "conversation with the chairman. Chairman Gensler, welcome once \n",
    "again to the committee.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It&#x27;s good to see you, sir.\n",
    "    Mr. Sessions. Thank you very much. Chairman Gensler, I \n",
    "think there is a lot of happy talk and smiling that takes place \n",
    "from you and your agency as they come up here, and they try and \n",
    "talk about the two principles of listening to stakeholders and \n",
    "industry participation. And yet, I think you are hearing across \n",
    "this committee that we wish we could have a better relationship \n",
    "with you and your entire organization. And we have applauded \n",
    "them, sent letters, done everything nice that you can do, and \n",
    "yet we show up here and we find a way to provide feedback. We \n",
    "would like to sincerely turn that around.\n",
    "    As you know, you and I spoke a couple of years ago about an \n",
    "issue that is still unresolved because the SEC would not even \n",
    "let this firm know what their problem was, and you told me it \n",
    "would take at least 214 days, because that is how long it takes \n",
    "before you are able to turn issues around, when your Fort Worth \n",
    "office already knew the answer. And I think it is this kind of \n",
    "action on behalf of the SEC that causes Members of Congress to \n",
    "react the way we do.\n",
    "    Last November, the SEC announced a massive increase in \n",
    "enforcement fines--$6.4 billion in 2022, up from $3.8 billion \n",
    "in 2021--and you have launched a regulatory crusade against the \n",
    "financial services industry through enforcement. You have told \n",
    "us that. We see that. Can you please tell me what you have done \n",
    "with the money from these enforcement actions, and where that \n",
    "money goes?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. First, sir, if I may, I think in the matter \n",
    "you talked to me about a week or so ago, we filed a civil \n",
    "litigated matter against that company, so I think that is all a \n",
    "matter of public record.\n",
    "    Mr. Sessions. Then, I have learned that now. Thank you.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Right.\n",
    "    Mr. Sessions. But for the 2 years prior to that, there was \n",
    "attempted resolution. And you even blocked that company from \n",
    "their counsel, who was very capable, from engaging in that, \n",
    "knowing what that was, where they could have corrected that or \n",
    "found a way to work with it because it put at least $50 million \n",
    "directly at risk. Mr. Chairman, can you explain where the money \n",
    "from these enforcement penalties is winding up?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. There are a number of places. Much of it goes \n",
    "into what is called fair funds. Congress helped set up a \n",
    "process where the public can actually get money back. Those \n",
    "that are harmed can get money back, and some of the penalties \n",
    "and so forth go into the U.S. Treasury, so some in fair funds \n",
    "and back to those who have been hurt, but some, of course, also \n",
    "go into the U.S. Treasury.\n",
    "    Mr. Sessions. So, the SEC takes the money and follows the \n",
    "laws that have been established.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Yes. We are funded separately, of course. We \n",
    "are appropriated----\n",
    "    Mr. Sessions. I didn&#x27;t know that.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. ----in that we are funded by fees that are \n",
    "fees on transactions and----\n",
    "    Mr. Sessions. Yes, sir. I just wanted to make sure that it \n",
    "is as a result of what Congress has established with the fair \n",
    "funds about what they would do with that money, and testimony \n",
    "today is that is what you have done with the $6.4 billion?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Not all of it, sir.\n",
    "    Mr. Sessions. Then, please add a comment and add the rest.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We can follow up with the details because of \n",
    "that----\n",
    "    Mr. Sessions. I am interested in following up on the \n",
    "details, and I would ask that your staff--just like Congressman \n",
    "Lucas sends a letter and your staff knows, oh, we got a letter \n",
    "from Congressman Lucas, let&#x27;s respond very quickly here, I \n",
    "would like to send you a letter today asking for those details.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Thank you. The actual breakdown is a matter of \n",
    "public record. We put it in our financials each year. I just \n",
    "don&#x27;t have it memorized.\n",
    "    Mr. Sessions. That is fair. I would not either. Mr. \n",
    "Chairman, we really, I think, would like to, on a bipartisan \n",
    "basis up here, have better interaction with your organization \n",
    "and with you, and I think what you have heard today is another \n",
    "calling on a bipartisan basis for us to do that. We believe if \n",
    "we express our opinion, you should express yours back, not just \n",
    "delay that. I want to thank you for being here, sir, and I will \n",
    "engage you on this matter. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. The \n",
    "gentleman yields back. The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott, \n",
    "is recognized for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Scott. Thank you very much. First of all, Chair \n",
    "Gensler, I agree with our ranking member, Ms. Waters. I believe \n",
    "you are doing an excellent job at a very difficult and \n",
    "challenging time facing our economy and especially our \n",
    "securities markets.\n",
    "    On July 12th, my good Republican friend, Congressman Frank \n",
    "Lucas, and I sent you a follow-up letter with respect to the \n",
    "SEC&#x27;s proposed rule regarding the impact of publicly disclosing \n",
    "proprietary positions in large security-based swaps above \n",
    "certain reporting thresholds. And specifically, Congressman \n",
    "Lucas and I raised concerns with how this move could impair \n",
    "market liquidity and hinder the SEC&#x27;s core mission to maintain \n",
    "fair, orderly, and efficient markets.\n",
    "    My question to you is, first, I know you have previously \n",
    "said you understood the law to require some public availability \n",
    "of this sensitive information. But where can you expand on \n",
    "whether widespread public access to large security-based swap \n",
    "(SBS) positions could in any way impair the ability of market \n",
    "participants to operate their trading business or limit their \n",
    "ability to hedge effectively?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We continue to consider at the staff level and \n",
    "the Commission level, not just your comment letter with \n",
    "Representative Lucas, but others about this, that securities-\n",
    "based swaps can be used to basically replicate the positions \n",
    "that are taken in the stock and bond markets, but particularly \n",
    "in the stock markets. And you might recall about 2 years ago, \n",
    "there was a family office called Archegos that did that and did \n",
    "that in quite some size. That is one of the reasons, not the \n",
    "only reason, but one of the reasons as we look at this, we say, \n",
    "Congress gave us this authority. This is one of the remaining \n",
    "authorities we had not addressed from Dodd-Frank.\n",
    "    And so, we took it up. We put a proposal out about the \n",
    "possible requirements to report to the Commission, and then in \n",
    "some cases report publicly these large either credit default \n",
    "swaps or total return swaps that, of course, credit default \n",
    "swaps were at the center of the 2008 crisis, and total return \n",
    "swaps were at the center of this one example, this Archegos \n",
    "example.\n",
    "    Mr. Scott. Yes. Now, let me ask you this question. Do you \n",
    "see any risk in allowing the public to take advantage of this \n",
    "information, for example, by facilitating front-running and \n",
    "copycat trading, which could drive up the costs for all market \n",
    "participants?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I believe we have gotten that comment from a \n",
    "number of commenters. It is taken up in our economic analysis, \n",
    "but it is an important issue of all public transparency. The \n",
    "markets can benefit from transparency, but sometimes, there is \n",
    "somebody that had an advantage of the opacity. When I was on \n",
    "Wall Street, we used to have a saying at the firm I was at, \n",
    "that darkness was our friend, and it was about how sometimes \n",
    "opacity helps make more money as a dealer. But it is not \n",
    "necessarily the case that the markets themselves--economists \n",
    "tend towards the transparency, which helps the proper pricing \n",
    "in the markets and also helps capital formation.\n",
    "    Mr. Scott. I am delighted with your presentation. I \n",
    "understand with low economic and finance that I handle at \n",
    "times, particularly with the stock market. Keep up the good \n",
    "work. Don&#x27;t get discouraged. We will get out of this mess in \n",
    "our financial markets. Thank you.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. I will \n",
    "now recognize the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Posey, for 5 \n",
    "minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Posey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And it&#x27;s good to see \n",
    "you, Chairman Gensler.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It&#x27;s good to see you, sir.\n",
    "    Mr. Posey. In spite of the SEC Inspector General and \n",
    "Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommendations, the SEC \n",
    "continues to assert that as an independent agency, the \n",
    "Commission is not required to do the same kind of regulatory \n",
    "analysis and cost-benefit analysis as other agencies. Why is \n",
    "the agency so defiant about the suggestion to be as accountable \n",
    "as other agencies?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Actually, sir, we follow the mandate. In 1996, \n",
    "Congress put in our statute that we had to do economic \n",
    "analysis, and we follow that. And then, after a number of court \n",
    "cases 20 years ago or so, we updated our guidance to ensure \n",
    "that we followed Congress&#x27; mandate, so we do economic analysis, \n",
    "again, sometimes measuring in a couple of hundred pages. In \n",
    "every one of our releases, we get feedback from the public, and \n",
    "then we adjust, and we modify.\n",
    "    Mr. Posey. So, the Inspector General is wrong? You don&#x27;t \n",
    "need to do any further analysis?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. In fact, we do need to do analysis because \n",
    "Congress mandated it. We have to analyze the efficiency, the \n",
    "competition, and the effects on capital formation, and in doing \n",
    "so, we lay out an economic baseline. And then, we have to look \n",
    "at alternatives to the proposal, reasonable alternatives, and \n",
    "we look at cost and benefits. We do all of that.\n",
    "    Mr. Posey. And any rules are in conformance with the \n",
    "Administrative Procedure Act?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Yes, we do that in compliance with the \n",
    "Administrative Procedure Act, but also, Congress added these \n",
    "other provisions in 1996, and, as I say, after a number of \n",
    "court interpretations, so that in 2005 and so forth, we updated \n",
    "how we did this, and we follow guidance that has been in place \n",
    "since 2012. I think I am the fourth Chair who has been \n",
    "following similar guidance for 11 years now.\n",
    "    Mr. Posey. Does the Commission assess and analyze \n",
    "cumulative economic impacts of the rules that it makes and the \n",
    "interrelationship with other agencies?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We analyze for each one a baseline, as I \n",
    "mentioned. So if, for instance, there was an interaction and we \n",
    "finalize a rule, then we necessarily update the baseline for \n",
    "the next consideration for the world as it exists at that point \n",
    "in time.\n",
    "    Mr. Posey. Okay. In your climate disclosure rule, are you \n",
    "requiring that firms pursuing ESG-directed investments also \n",
    "disclose the risks they face from favorable regulations not \n",
    "materializing or climate subsidies drying up or slowing down?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. The proposal is really to capture the risks \n",
    "that investors want to understand. The proposal was about both \n",
    "the opportunities and the risks, and I think you did use this \n",
    "word--it is about, ``materiality.&#x27;&#x27; We are not a climate \n",
    "regulator. We are really a disclosure-based regulator, and \n",
    "thousands of investors, more than thousands but representing \n",
    "tens of trillions of dollars of assets today, are making \n",
    "investment decisions, and I will share a statistic with you. Of \n",
    "the Russell 1000, the top thousand companies in the U.S., 81 \n",
    "percent currently make climate risk disclosures, and 57 percent \n",
    "disclose their greenhouse gas Scope 1 and Scope 2. So, what we \n",
    "are trying to do is just try to bring some comparability to \n",
    "that, in a sense, too, for investors, but also to avoid some \n",
    "greenwashing, frankly, so to bring some comparability to that, \n",
    "which is already happening.\n",
    "    Mr. Posey. Based on your strategic planning, which of your \n",
    "proposed rules is most vulnerable to the major questions \n",
    "doctrine set down in West Virginia v. EPA.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We really do everything we can to stay within \n",
    "the laws as Congress had passed and how courts interpret them. \n",
    "We are familiar with the case, the Supreme Court case. It is \n",
    "the law of the land, as you mentioned, and we take a very close \n",
    "look at that to ensure that when we finalize rules, it is \n",
    "within the laws and how the courts interpret it.\n",
    "    Mr. Posey. Are you trying to resolve any of those major \n",
    "questions at this time?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I would broaden it out, sir. It is like any \n",
    "time the Supreme Court speaks to us broadly, the administrative \n",
    "state&#x27;s authorities, we take a look at that, and we take a look \n",
    "at every comment we receive from the public to stay within our \n",
    "authorities.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\n",
    "    Mr. Posey. Thank you.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. I will now recognize the gentleman from \n",
    "Missouri, Mr. Cleaver, for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Cleaver. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, \n",
    "Chairman Gensler, for being here today. I am one of those \n",
    "people who believes that there is such a thing as climate \n",
    "change, and I agree with the scientists, I guess. Most of the \n",
    "warming that we are experiencing actually took place over the \n",
    "last 40 years, and the last 9 years are the warmest \n",
    "temperatures that we have had since keeping track of the \n",
    "weather temperatures.\n",
    "    And I am from Kansas City, Missouri. The Missouri is the \n",
    "second-longest water system in North America. The water heads \n",
    "up in Montana, snakes its way all the way through Missouri, and \n",
    "then meets up with the Mississippi in St. Louis. It goes \n",
    "through seven States. And the only reason I am mentioning that \n",
    "is that we are experiencing all kinds of events along the \n",
    "Missouri River system. We have had droughts, flooding is \n",
    "becoming more volatile, and weather events are becoming more \n",
    "extreme and are impacting the Missouri River, and this becomes \n",
    "uneconomical in the sense that the low water levels, which are \n",
    "reaching sometimes record lows, disrupt business.\n",
    "    We do a lot of barge trafficking on the Missouri and \n",
    "Mississippi Rivers, and that is being disrupted, and the crisis \n",
    "puts into question our viability and long-term dependability. \n",
    "So, I was pleased that in March of last year, the SEC released \n",
    "the proposed rules to require public companies to make a \n",
    "variety of quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding \n",
    "climate-related risks. Is there any company, any kind of \n",
    "economic interest in the United States that you think would be \n",
    "immune from climate risk as we are dealing with this? We may \n",
    "not be dealing with it as powerfully as we should, but are \n",
    "there any exemptions that you can think of--companies or \n",
    "corporations--that would not be impacted or are not being \n",
    "impacted today?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Again, I understand your views. We are not a \n",
    "climate regulator.\n",
    "    Mr. Cleaver. I understand.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It is a matter of investors making investment \n",
    "choices, and for some companies, investors are getting \n",
    "disclosures, and we are trying to bring some comparability to \n",
    "those disclosures. For some companies, it is viewed as \n",
    "material, and for some companies, it is not. That is an \n",
    "important distinction, of course. But there are so many \n",
    "different sectors and so many different industries in this \n",
    "country, and we are merit-neutral, but we are not disclosure-\n",
    "neutral. And right now, 80-plus percent of the housing \n",
    "companies are already making disclosures. It is really our \n",
    "responsibility to bring some consistency and comparability for \n",
    "investors to get decision-useful information.\n",
    "    Mr. Cleaver. Yes. I am not suggesting that you are the EPA \n",
    "or some kind of climatologist. I just want to make sure that \n",
    "the SEC continues to measure the impact through its disclosures \n",
    "of what is going on dangerously with climate change and that it \n",
    "will all impact corporations.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I would say this. We have 16,000 comments. We \n",
    "have heard very consistently from investors that they find this \n",
    "information decision-useful and they would benefit from more \n",
    "consistency and comparability in the information they are, \n",
    "frankly, already receiving, so that is what we are focused on.\n",
    "    Mr. Cleaver. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. We will \n",
    "now recognize the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Luetkemeyer, who \n",
    "is also the Chair of our National Security Subcommittee, for 5 \n",
    "minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Gensler, \n",
    "my good colleague here, Mr. Cleaver, and I wrote to you in May \n",
    "regarding the SEC&#x27;s re-proposed Rule Number 192, prohibition \n",
    "against conflicts of interest in certain securitizations, and \n",
    "our concerns about the potential treatment of mortgage \n",
    "insurance-linked notes (MILNs). Our letter was filed under the \n",
    "bulk of all comment letters, and the first sentence asked for a \n",
    "clarification of the language that is in your rule. So, we are \n",
    "disappointed with the interpretation of our letter, which is \n",
    "pretty plain from the standpoint that we would like to have an \n",
    "answer. But mortgage insurers are a significant source of \n",
    "private capital in the housing finance system, and these \n",
    "transactions are an important tool to reduce taxpayer risk \n",
    "exposure and cost.\n",
    "    Question number one, do you agree that Federal policy \n",
    "should encourage more private capital in the housing market, \n",
    "especially when it involves well-capitalized and highly-rated \n",
    "entities?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I think there are other agencies that are \n",
    "responsible there, but certainly our role at the SEC is to \n",
    "facilitate a mortgage market. We oversee, I don&#x27;t know, an $11-\n",
    "trillion or $13-trillion mortgage securitization market. And \n",
    "what we are trying to do in that market, like other markets, is \n",
    "to drive for greater efficiency and, as you say, opportunity \n",
    "for homeowners.\n",
    "    Mr. Luetkemeyer. The question is, can you be a partner with \n",
    "the private sector? In other words, reinsurance for these \n",
    "companies is very important to allow the spread of risk and \n",
    "then, of course, the reduction of cost. The question is pretty \n",
    "simple: Would you support something like that?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I think, if I understand the question, it&#x27;s \n",
    "that mortgage originators also rely on mortgage insurance, and \n",
    "I agree that is an important part of the market.\n",
    "    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Okay. In our letter, we say that the \n",
    "rulemaking may unintentionally prohibit private insurers from \n",
    "procuring reinsurance by the capital markets through these \n",
    "MILNs, which would negatively impact homebuyers, lenders, and \n",
    "taxpayers. Are you considering changes to the rule to clarify \n",
    "the treatment of mortgage insurance-linked notes?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Without prejudging any adopting release, we \n",
    "are considering all the comments, including yours, these \n",
    "individual letters you reference. Congress gave us a mandate \n",
    "that we had to help ensure that underwriters and sponsors of \n",
    "certain mortgage securitizations be bet against their \n",
    "investors, and that is what we are trying to do.\n",
    "    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Mr. Gensler, the letter should not be \n",
    "canned with the comment letters. It is a request for you to \n",
    "clarify what you are trying to accomplish here, and the letter \n",
    "pointed out what we need clarification of, so we would \n",
    "appreciate a response. Thank you for that.\n",
    "    I also sit on the House Select Committee on the Chinese \n",
    "Communist Party. And as a result of my position there, and the \n",
    "chairmanship of our National Security and Illicit Financing \n",
    "Subcommittee, in 2022, the Public Company Accounting Oversight \n",
    "Board (PCAOB) inspection reports of Mainland China and Hong \n",
    "Kong accounting firms, which audit U.S.-listed Chinese \n",
    "companies, were scathing, and a reminder that financial \n",
    "statements produced by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-\n",
    "controlled companies should never be trusted. Both reports \n",
    "showed unacceptable rates of Part I.A deficiencies, which are \n",
    "deficiencies so large that PCAOB staff believe the audit firm \n",
    "failed to obtain sufficient audit evidence to support its work \n",
    "on the public company&#x27;s financial statements. Essentially, the \n",
    "audits were useless. Is it correct that under the Holding \n",
    "Foreign Companies Accountable Act, these two firms, which \n",
    "failed so spectacularly, will not be inspected again by the \n",
    "PCAOB for another 2 to 3 years?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I am not familiar enough with the PCAOB&#x27;s \n",
    "rotating schedule, but it is accurate that when the PCAOB goes \n",
    "to inspect an auditing firm in any country, they don&#x27;t have the \n",
    "staff to go in on an annual basis.\n",
    "    Mr. Luetkemeyer. The premise is correct that they only have \n",
    "to do it every 2 to 3 years, so Mr. Sherman and I have \n",
    "introduced a piece of bipartisan legislation that would require \n",
    "them to have an annual audit. In 2020, there were 1,000 \n",
    "companies on the exchange, and it now stands between 250 and \n",
    "300. A lot of them are shell companies, and when were \n",
    "threatened with an audit, they suddenly disappeared. The \n",
    "funneling of our capital to Chinese companies/the Chinese \n",
    "Government and the Chinese Communist Party has to stop, and we \n",
    "would appreciate your support for something like that, and just \n",
    "a quick comment, yes or no?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Look, I think it is really important. If \n",
    "somebody wants to issue stock in the U.S., they need to comply \n",
    "with their laws.\n",
    "    Mrs. Wagner. [presiding]. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Usually, with China, that is very important.\n",
    "    Mr. Luetkemeyer. Thank you very much. I yield back.\n",
    "    Mrs. Wagner. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now \n",
    "recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut, Mr. Himes, for 5 \n",
    "minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Himes. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and thanks for \n",
    "joining us today, Chairman Gensler. I want to talk with you for \n",
    "3 minutes or so about my ongoing efforts to codify insider \n",
    "trading into law, but I do want to take a minute here, since we \n",
    "are on the verge of a government shutdown, to just see how that \n",
    "affects you and your organization.\n",
    "    It is sort of taken for granted around here that a shutdown \n",
    "is going to occur because my friends on the other side of the \n",
    "aisle can&#x27;t find the coherence to pass a rule on the House \n",
    "Floor, much less do what we know needs to be done to avoid a \n",
    "shutdown, which is to pass a bipartisan continuing resolution. \n",
    "The Senate has figured that out. They are working on that. We \n",
    "will figure that out eventually. In the meantime, to \n",
    "demonstrate the importance of doing that, we are going to shut \n",
    "down the government because of some MAGA extremists.\n",
    "    Now, we get asked all the time about the very visible \n",
    "stuff. We will be treated in the next couple of weeks to the \n",
    "sight of 19-year-old Marines and sailors lining up at food \n",
    "banks because they won&#x27;t know if they are getting paid. The \n",
    "Small Business Administration (SBA) will be shut down, and they \n",
    "will not be able to lend to small businesses, and those small \n",
    "businesses may go under. We could go on with all of the public \n",
    "stuff.\n",
    "    But you lead an organization that has an awful lot of \n",
    "people who could be making a lot more money at a bank or at a \n",
    "law firm, who are going to be told that they are nonessential, \n",
    "and who may be furloughed. So, let me just give you a minute or \n",
    "so here. I am curious, even though it is not going to make \n",
    "headlines, what would a shutdown do to morale and capability \n",
    "inside the Securities and Exchange Commission?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It is a remarkable, dedicated staff. We are \n",
    "looking at probably 90 to 93 percent of our staff will be \n",
    "furloughed, so we will be down to a skeleton crew of about 7 to \n",
    "8 percent of our staff. In terms of what it would do for \n",
    "morale, I think that history shows, because we had one of these \n",
    "in 2018, for 35 days at that point in time, that it is hard on \n",
    "people. It is hard because they are not getting a paycheck. It \n",
    "is hard because, as you rightly say, they can get jobs at law \n",
    "firms and elsewhere, and they are just really dedicated public \n",
    "servants.\n",
    "    In terms of the markets, I would say if a company were \n",
    "deciding to go public or raise offerings, they would want to go \n",
    "effective before Friday if they are ready to. If not, they \n",
    "might be in a sort of a subliminal state where they can&#x27;t \n",
    "access the markets because we can&#x27;t effectively review those--\n",
    "--\n",
    "    Mr. Himes. Let me redirect you for a second to, a company \n",
    "is raising capital, but your SEC is a whipping boy. You know \n",
    "that, but the truth is the organization is full of people who \n",
    "are out there prosecuting fraud, who are stopping insider \n",
    "trading. Are we going to see, if there is a meaningful \n",
    "shutdown, fraud go unprosecuted, and insider trading? You won&#x27;t \n",
    "have the capacity to address these things which hurt the \n",
    "American public, correct?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Yes. While somebody can still file a tip, \n",
    "complaint, and referral, or somebody could file as a \n",
    "whistleblower, there won&#x27;t be the people on the other side to \n",
    "really review it and investigate it.\n",
    "    Mr. Himes. Thank you. Okay. Speaking of insider trading, I \n",
    "want to just briefly discuss with you something I have worked \n",
    "on for 7 years now, which, as you know, is trying to define, \n",
    "``insider trading,&#x27;&#x27; in law. It is not defined in law today, as \n",
    "you know, and as a result, we have court-made law, Newman, \n",
    "Solomon, and Martoma overturning each other, creating a great \n",
    "deal of uncertainty, prosecutions being overturned, convictions \n",
    "being overturned, a great deal of uncertainty. I am a believer \n",
    "in this idea that if we are going to send somebody to jail, we \n",
    "should be very clear about why we are doing that.\n",
    "    So, I would love to get a minute or so from you about, \n",
    "where are we? Would we benefit from a codified statute on \n",
    "insider trading law? Would that remove some of the uncertainty \n",
    "and remove some of the chance that the courts will overturn \n",
    "your traditional activities?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I think that we have had the benefit at the \n",
    "agency of robust, as you said, largely court-made law from the \n",
    "1980s on, and you referenced some cases even in the last 6 to 7 \n",
    "years. But I think we have provided you and other Members, if I \n",
    "remember correctly, technical assistance on a legislative \n",
    "package that you had last year, if I recall, that almost made \n",
    "it into the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), if I \n",
    "recall. But again, I think that we have good, robust \n",
    "authorities, but the technical assistance, I recall, supported \n",
    "what you were trying to achieve.\n",
    "    Mr. Himes. And I think you gave us this technical \n",
    "assistance if we could preserve those authorities that are \n",
    "legacy authorities, if you will, but if we could----\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. That was the key, that we didn&#x27;t want to in \n",
    "any way lose the authorities all the way up to the Supreme \n",
    "Court that we had had.\n",
    "    Mr. Himes. Right, but I see you nodding. If we could codify \n",
    "a definition of, ``insider trading,&#x27;&#x27; and reduce some of the \n",
    "risk of overturning of case-made law, that might, in the long \n",
    "run, simplify your task and create confidence in the in the \n",
    "markets, correct?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Yes, and, again, we should follow up with \n",
    "staff, but our major concern was that we not somehow undo some \n",
    "of the really good law that is in place.\n",
    "    Mrs. Wagner. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\n",
    "    Mr. Himes. Thank you, Chairman Gensler.\n",
    "    Mrs. Wagner. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now \n",
    "recognizes herself for 5 minutes. Chair Gensler, while you were \n",
    "a professor at MIT, you spoke at length about how technology \n",
    "could be used to democratize finance. In fact, in a podcast \n",
    "entitled, ``Paying it Forward with FinTech with Professor Gary \n",
    "Gensler,&#x27;&#x27; you stated, ``What I was drawn to at MIT was this \n",
    "sense that maybe we can democratize capitalism a bit more, that \n",
    "we can use technology to make finance more inclusive and more \n",
    "accessible to many more millions of people in our country and \n",
    "many more hundreds of millions of people around the globe.&#x27;&#x27;\n",
    "    Now, sir, as Chair of the SEC, you have put forward a \n",
    "predictive data analytics proposal that jeopardizes the \n",
    "innovation and technology that has made investing available to \n",
    "millions more Americans than ever before.\n",
    "    And I am confused as to which Gary Gensler the American \n",
    "public should believe, the academic version, who spoke \n",
    "glowingly about the power of technology to help more investors \n",
    "participate in U.S. and global capital markets, or the SEC \n",
    "version, who apparently thinks all use of any technology by \n",
    "broker-dealers and investment advisers is inherently conflicted \n",
    "and that firms should just stop using technology altogether. \n",
    "Chair Gensler, could you please briefly explain this change in \n",
    "your views?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I thank you for the question. It&#x27;s a clever \n",
    "question. It is the same Gary Gensler. It is not my identical \n",
    "twin brother, Rob, or anything. It is me, and I believe \n",
    "technology is so transformative, and I think artificial \n",
    "intelligence and machine learning is transforming this decade \n",
    "and so forth. I think robo advisers and brokerage apps, whether \n",
    "they are using these new technologies or some of the older \n",
    "predictive data analytics, should just stand by the basic \n",
    "concept that the investor is first, not the investment adviser \n",
    "is first. That is all.\n",
    "    Mrs. Wagner. We agree there. And this proposal fails to \n",
    "acknowledge the already-existing and well-functioning SEC \n",
    "regulations, such as Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI), and the \n",
    "fiduciary standard that protects investors. I would really urge \n",
    "you to withdraw this regulation, as we already have this in \n",
    "place.\n",
    "    During your last appearance in front of this committee, I \n",
    "asked you, sir, if you were planning to rewrite Regulation Best \n",
    "Interest (Reg BI), and you said that it was not currently on \n",
    "your agenda. However, the Commission&#x27;s proposal on conflicts of \n",
    "interest associated with the use of predictive data analytics \n",
    "effectively rewrites Reg BI by holding broker-dealers and \n",
    "investment advisers to a higher standard of conduct and \n",
    "conflict neutralization than Reg BI. Were you intentionally \n",
    "withholding your plans to supersede Reg BI, sir, with a new \n",
    "proposal, when you testified in April?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I feel the same as I did in April. I think \n",
    "this doesn&#x27;t change Regulation Best Interest or the fiduciary \n",
    "interpretation. This does build on them an important area \n",
    "around using predictive data analytics. It is a little bit of a \n",
    "math thing, but if the math is basically putting the investment \n",
    "advisers interest ahead of the investors, if it is making a \n",
    "recommendation or it is giving a nudge, a behavioral nudge, to \n",
    "steer somebody somewhere, therein lies a conflict. That is what \n",
    "we are trying to----\n",
    "    Mrs. Wagner. It is too broad. We don&#x27;t even know what \n",
    "technology would be applied here, and at the core, Reg BI has a \n",
    "fiduciary standard, the best interest, that is already there. \n",
    "You are now superseding that, and it is not just duplicative; \n",
    "it potentially throws out the fiduciary rule in Reg BI, so I, \n",
    "again, would encourage you, and I think we have bipartisan \n",
    "support, to withdraw this rule as soon as possible.\n",
    "    And let me just ask you this question since I have limited \n",
    "time, because this is a question I have sent you to which we \n",
    "haven&#x27;t received a response: How many staff with the Division \n",
    "of Trading and Markets, the Division of Investment Management, \n",
    "and the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis were actively \n",
    "involved in drafting the predictive data analytics proposal?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I don&#x27;t have a number, but I would say that \n",
    "generally speaking----\n",
    "    Mrs. Wagner. Do they have advanced degrees in computer \n",
    "science, data science, or engineering, sir?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. A number of them have advanced degrees in \n",
    "economics and computer science, but I don&#x27;t know how many of \n",
    "them do.\n",
    "    Mrs. Wagner. I have sent you a list of questions, and I \n",
    "would love to have those answers. My time has expired.\n",
    "    The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. \n",
    "Foster, for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Foster. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and I want to \n",
    "thank our witness for staying up until 9:30 p.m. to accept and \n",
    "analyze the just-in-time delivery of our bipartisan letter with \n",
    "16 Republicans and 16 Democrats on it, that French Hill and I \n",
    "prepared.\n",
    "    I want to make sure that you understand what the meaning of \n",
    "that letter is. It is not that you should stop working on the \n",
    "market reforms in parallel with 605 upgrades. Our intention is \n",
    "that you actually get the 605 done so that you have upgraded \n",
    "reporting of quality of order execution and so on and have that \n",
    "in place so you can have a look at the data, then finalize the \n",
    "market reforms and watch, hopefully, the quality of order \n",
    "execution improve. And so, the meaning of the letter is to \n",
    "sequence those in that way, but not to cease all work on the \n",
    "planning and so on of the market structure reforms, so please \n",
    "read the end of the first paragraph carefully. One of the \n",
    "reasons it was late is that we did a certain amount of \n",
    "wordsmithing to get that right.\n",
    "    And I also want to comment a little bit on, it was on your \n",
    "shift when we had the flash crash, right? You were running the \n",
    "CFTC during the flash crash. I remember when we had a hearing \n",
    "maybe 4 days afterward. The CFTC had, the night of the flash \n",
    "crash, 30 people with the entire trading history on their \n",
    "laptops figuring out what the heck happened, and 4 days later, \n",
    "the SEC, which did not have a Consolidated Audit Trail-like \n",
    "structure in place, was still collecting the data to figure out \n",
    "what the heck happened. And I think that is why we should not \n",
    "lose sight of making the Consolidated Audit Trail a success and \n",
    "really do it, and I think that is a separable discussion from \n",
    "the beneficial owner and cybersecurity issues there.\n",
    "    And in particular, one of the things that I raised with you \n",
    "last time you were in front of our committee here, was I asked \n",
    "you about the possibility of actually using the Consolidated \n",
    "Audit Trail to simplify much of the reporting requirements \n",
    "under Rule 605, so that instead of making a requirement of \n",
    "every one of the zillions of companies that would have to do \n",
    "it, that you would simply use the fact that the Consolidated \n",
    "Audit Trail has the information necessary to make a public \n",
    "report on a quality of order execution for the different \n",
    "brokerages so that you could simply have either FINRA or some \n",
    "competent private subcontractor, like an S3 or similar, just \n",
    "have them write a piece of software that is run that provides \n",
    "this report based on the Consolidated Audit Trail. This \n",
    "actually will relieve the regulatory burden on a lot of the \n",
    "market participants and get something that was guaranteed to be \n",
    "an apples-to-apples, well-defined comparison of the quality of \n",
    "order execution.\n",
    "    Have you had time since we spoke on this to put any thought \n",
    "into that idea and see if that is a useful way to simplify and \n",
    "speed up the 605 reporting?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I want to compliment you on your excellent \n",
    "memory of 13 years ago when I was at the CFTC----\n",
    "    Mr. Foster. It was seared in pain.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. What did you say?\n",
    "    Mr. Foster. It was seared in pain when----\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Seared in pain?\n",
    "    Mr. Foster. It was like we were in a car accident.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It was the very next morning that the CFTC had \n",
    "all that information. The SEC did not. You are raising an idea \n",
    "as to whether the Consolidated Audit Trail could be used for \n",
    "data about the quality of order execution. And although it is \n",
    "possible that technologists could figure and sort that through, \n",
    "that in and of itself would raise costs and benefits as well, \n",
    "and everybody has encouraged us to always look at cost and \n",
    "benefits. I would just say, currently, market participants, \n",
    "brokers, can quantify their order quality. That is what this \n",
    "Rule 605 actually----\n",
    "    Mr. Foster. That is right, but then you have to make sure \n",
    "it is an apples-to-apples comparison. If there is an ambiguity, \n",
    "they will resolve it in favor of making their numbers look \n",
    "good. You are going to have to have some of your employees \n",
    "looking over that, whereas if you just say, okay, find a \n",
    "competent entity, S3 seems to have a pretty good market share \n",
    "of doing that already or FINRA, to just write one piece of \n",
    "software, make it public, and run that piece of software in the \n",
    "Consolidated Audit Trail so that everyone understands exactly \n",
    "what numbers are being reported.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. One thing is the Consolidated Audit Trail does \n",
    "not capture and compare the orders--you put an order out and \n",
    "here is the actual quality, so more requirements, I think, go \n",
    "into the Consolidated Audit Trail, but we can follow up on that \n",
    "further.\n",
    "    Mr. Foster. No, I think it actually could----\n",
    "    Mrs. Wagner. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. The Chair \n",
    "now recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. Barr, for 5 \n",
    "minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Barr. Chairman Gensler, have you ever spoken to Senator \n",
    "Menendez about the Security and Exchange Commission&#x27;s Director \n",
    "of Enforcement, Gurbir Grewal?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. No.\n",
    "    Mr. Barr. On May 20, 2021, your public calendar notes a \n",
    "call with Senator Menendez. What was discussed during that \n",
    "call, if you can remember?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It was 2 years ago, sir, but if I recall, \n",
    "there was a discussion about possible disclosure by public \n",
    "companies of political contributions.\n",
    "    Mr. Barr. You hired Mr. Grewal as the SEC&#x27;s Director of \n",
    "Enforcement shortly after that May 20th call. Are you aware of \n",
    "the glowing statement in support that was put out by Senator \n",
    "Menendez praising your hire?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I thank you for letting me know that, but \n",
    "until you told me or until today----\n",
    "    Mr. Barr. I am deeply concerned about this, and I will be \n",
    "following up with your office with additional questions, and I \n",
    "expect a written response.\n",
    "    Mr. Chairman, I really liked your colorful testimony. And \n",
    "you are right, we are blessed with the largest, most-\n",
    "sophisticated, most-innovative capital markets in the world, \n",
    "but we cannot take this for granted. Even a gold medalist must \n",
    "keep training. With all due respect, Mr. Chairman, if the U.S. \n",
    "capital markets are a gold medalist, you are the Tonya Harding \n",
    "of securities regulation because you are kneecapping the U.S. \n",
    "capital markets with the avalanche of red tape coming out of \n",
    "your Commission.\n",
    "    On your climate disclosure rule proposal, you say that the \n",
    "SEC is merit-neutral, that your focus on consistency and \n",
    "comparability of disclosure is not the merit of the investment, \n",
    "so that is just not believable. Requiring Scope 3 emissions \n",
    "will lead to wildly inaccurate and immaterial disclosures that \n",
    "will be of little practical use to investors. They would also \n",
    "unfairly and inaccurately portray companies as major polluters \n",
    "that, in reality, have very low carbon footprints.\n",
    "    Let&#x27;s be honest, the agenda here is not to provide \n",
    "investors with relevant information but instead to redirect \n",
    "capital away from fossil energy. Your proposal would \n",
    "discriminate against fossil energy. And you have repeatedly \n",
    "claimed that these disclosures are rooted in investor \n",
    "protection, but the largest U.S. energy exchange-traded fund is \n",
    "up 15 percent over the last 3 months. It is near its highest \n",
    "level in 9 years. How is it protecting investors to deter \n",
    "investment in profitable companies?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. This is not doing that, with all due respect. \n",
    "All it is about is trying to bring some comparability to \n",
    "disclosures being made. We are not a climate agency.\n",
    "    Mr. Barr. I know. I have heard you say that.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We are really not, sir.\n",
    "    Mr. Barr. Let&#x27;s be honest. We know what is going on. You \n",
    "are trying to, ``Scarlet Letter,&#x27;&#x27; fossil energy.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We are not. We are not, sir.\n",
    "    Mr. Barr. I know you say you are not, but we got the joke. \n",
    "Everybody knows what you are doing. You are trying to redirect \n",
    "capital away. You are trying to discriminate against fossil \n",
    "energy, notwithstanding your protests. Most American investors \n",
    "find all of the Scope 3 emissions nonsense and immaterial. It \n",
    "is immaterial. I know institutional investors talk about this, \n",
    "but this is about an agenda to discriminate against fossil \n",
    "energy, which is profitable. That is not protecting investors. \n",
    "That is hurting investors. It is steering them into less-\n",
    "diversified lower-performing funds.\n",
    "    Let me move on to the perfect storm of regulations. Have \n",
    "you consulted with Vice Chair Barr about the Basel III Endgame \n",
    "and the interplay between what you are doing on capital markets \n",
    "regulation and what is happening in commercial real estate? I \n",
    "am very concerned about this because Basel III will increase \n",
    "the cost of credit, diminish lending capacity, and undermine \n",
    "the role that banks play in lending and financial \n",
    "intermediation in commercial real estate.\n",
    "    Have you talked to the Federal Reserve about how this \n",
    "interacts with the conflicts of interest in securitization \n",
    "rule, the Rule 15c2-11 private funds custody rule, and others, \n",
    "because I am really worried that Basel III Endgame and all of \n",
    "your regulatory proposals would lead to a death by a thousand \n",
    "cuts for commercial real estate, when we are looking at \n",
    "maturities of $1.5 trillion in commercial real estate over the \n",
    "next 3 years. And it is not just about refinancing from 3 \n",
    "percent to now 8 percent. It is the fact that Basel III and \n",
    "then all of the non-bank activity is going to be sidelined as a \n",
    "result of the interplay between Basel III and your regulations.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We have ongoing conversations with the Federal \n",
    "Reserve about a number of our rules, but they really have the \n",
    "lead on Basel III. That is not something we consult with them \n",
    "on.\n",
    "    Mr. Barr. Okay. I think----\n",
    "    Mrs. Wagner. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. I would ask \n",
    "you to submit the answer for the record.\n",
    "    Mr. Barr. ----the interplay is important. I yield back.\n",
    "    Mrs. Wagner. The Chair now recognizes the gentlewoman from \n",
    "Ohio, Mrs. Beatty, for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mrs. Beatty. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and thank you, \n",
    "Chairman Gensler, for being here today. I am going to get to a \n",
    "question that I would like to ask you on the proposal regarding \n",
    "predictive data analysis. But in light of the colorful \n",
    "questioning and use of language with, ``discrimination,&#x27;&#x27; and, \n",
    "``kneecapping,&#x27;&#x27; I want to ask you about the shutdown, because \n",
    "I think my Republican colleagues are kneecapping the American \n",
    "people and those who serve this country and those that we took \n",
    "an oath to protect, and certainly, at least the last five \n",
    "government shutdowns have happened under Republican leadership. \n",
    "You represent this large organization, and if there was a \n",
    "government shutdown, would that grind the SEC to a halt, yes or \n",
    "no, in your opinion?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We would have a skeleton staff.\n",
    "    Mrs. Beatty. And does that mean if there was a shutdown \n",
    "with your approximately 4,600 employees, you would be left with \n",
    "maybe only 400 employees who were not furloughed?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. That is correct.\n",
    "    Mrs. Beatty. And the remainder would be furloughed without \n",
    "pay?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Yes, that is correct. Even though they are \n",
    "working, it would be without pay.\n",
    "    Mrs. Beatty. Right. And these are hardworking American \n",
    "people with families and children who would be considerably, \n",
    "``kneecapped,&#x27;&#x27; by my Republican colleagues, who have so much \n",
    "concern about what we are doing. And would that have some \n",
    "effect on the registration statements for new users, and offers \n",
    "of securities, and surveilling the functionings and operations \n",
    "of capital markets?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I think you could say, largely, the initial \n",
    "public offering market would be shut down with the government.\n",
    "    Mrs. Beatty. And would you say investors would be \n",
    "vulnerable to fraud, and businesses would be deprived of their \n",
    "opportunity to access capital markets?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I would say that while we will have a skeleton \n",
    "staff, it will be hard for us to oversee the markets.\n",
    "    Mrs. Beatty. And that is what you are charged with doing, \n",
    "like we are responsible for keeping the government open and \n",
    "protecting the American people. You probably would agree with \n",
    "that. I am not going to ask you to answer that.\n",
    "    So now, let me get on to my question, after I feel a little \n",
    "renewed in letting the American people know that while we are \n",
    "here, we can ask all kinds of questions. But if we want to talk \n",
    "about economic analysis, if we want to talk about threats of \n",
    "subpoenas for not being direct, let&#x27;s talk about what is \n",
    "happening to the American people in real time. But with that \n",
    "said, I am going to give you an opportunity to talk about this \n",
    "proposal that we have heard a lot about.\n",
    "    I understand that the proposal is currently very broad in \n",
    "scope, covering the range of investor interactions, including \n",
    "communications through covered firms&#x27; public websites. There is \n",
    "concern that it could even encompass financial education tools \n",
    "for investors, and it could cover things such as an application \n",
    "that analyzes an investor&#x27;s future retirement assets by \n",
    "changing the inputs for different mixes of assets. Can you \n",
    "address the concerns or take the rest of my time to talk about \n",
    "this proposal so we can understand it better?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. One thing I would say is this hearing comes at \n",
    "a timely moment, because the comment period is open until \n",
    "October 10th on this particular rule. But this rule really just \n",
    "has a basic concept that if you are engaging with investors, \n",
    "that those investors&#x27; interests come before that of the \n",
    "investment adviser or broker-dealer, and if you are using \n",
    "predictive data analytics to determine how to nudge them or \n",
    "guide them, you should be not putting your interest.\n",
    "    Look, in my downtime, I like to watch romantic comedies on \n",
    "streaming apps. If the streaming app figures out that I am a \n",
    "romcom guy, which I am, and they are doing it because they make \n",
    "more money because I watch the streaming app more----\n",
    "    Mrs. Beatty. There you go.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Okay. But in finance, if you are doing it and \n",
    "you are nudging somebody to trade more and churn up their hard-\n",
    "earned assets, or nudging them to margin or options trading or \n",
    "higher fees on a robo adviser, and it is not in their interest, \n",
    "but it is in the investment adviser&#x27;s interest, therein lies a \n",
    "conflict. That is what we are trying to address.\n",
    "    Mrs. Beatty. Thank you.\n",
    "    Mrs. Wagner. The gentlelady&#x27;s time----\n",
    "    Mrs. Beatty. And my time is up.\n",
    "    Mrs. Wagner. The gentlelady yields back, and the Chair now \n",
    "recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Williams, for 5 \n",
    "minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Williams of Texas. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. The \n",
    "SEC&#x27;s recent climate rule proposal was 500 pages of mandatory \n",
    "disclosures that will now require companies to report on \n",
    "emissions data and climate risk management strategies. Now, \n",
    "this proposal is a major concern for business owners back in my \n",
    "district, who are worried--I am a small business owner also--\n",
    "about the SEC&#x27;s recent push to implement costly environmental, \n",
    "social, and political regulatory requirements that are not even \n",
    "relevant to the company. The SEC&#x27;s proposed climate \n",
    "requirements will cost companies millions of dollars to ensure \n",
    "they properly comply with these burdensome rules. This will \n",
    "force business owners to hire more lawyers and compliance \n",
    "officers rather than investing back in their employees and \n",
    "operations, which would help their businesses grow and bring \n",
    "more in revenue, and I have seen that happen in my business.\n",
    "    So, businesses are already struggling to operate within \n",
    "tight margins, and an increase in compliance costs could be \n",
    "their tipping point. And on top of that, the Scope 3 emissions \n",
    "disclosure will direct companies to speculate on the emissions \n",
    "output for their suppliers and products, which requires \n",
    "substantial information in order to get a proper estimate. This \n",
    "could lead to smaller businesses being left out due to how \n",
    "difficult it is for them to obtain this complex information. \n",
    "And the SEC crusade is extremely out-of-touch and exceeds their \n",
    "intended missions and statutory authority, so the SEC needs to \n",
    "stop their abuse of the rulemaking process before they cause \n",
    "any further damage to the industry.\n",
    "    Mr. Chairman, what is the average amount of time and \n",
    "resources everyday companies will need to ensure they are \n",
    "properly complying with the excessive climate risk disclosures, \n",
    "and how can mandating companies to file on indirect emissions \n",
    "related to their company provide consistent information for \n",
    "investors?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Mr. Barr, sitting behind you, asked a similar \n",
    "question. Let me just put it in context, if I may. Investors \n",
    "today are making investment decisions based on climate risk \n",
    "disclosures. We are trying to bring some comparability. You and \n",
    "other members have raised this question about greenhouse gas \n",
    "emissions, so-called Scope 3, and for the listening public, \n",
    "this is of the value chain. It is not about the company itself. \n",
    "It is about their suppliers or their customers.\n",
    "    And we got a lot of comments in the public file about this, \n",
    "not just from Members of Congress, but from small and mid-sized \n",
    "enterprises in your district and other districts, from farmers \n",
    "and ranchers, and the like. We are taking a very close look at \n",
    "this. Our remit, our legal authority is about public companies. \n",
    "It is about the public companies, and over half of the top \n",
    "1,000 are already making disclosures around their emissions, \n",
    "but we understood even in the proposal that so-called Scope 3 \n",
    "is less-developed, and is less-used. And we got a lot of \n",
    "feedback, and we are taking that under consideration and \n",
    "looking at it very closely.\n",
    "    Mr. Williams of Texas. Because when you make small \n",
    "businesses smaller because of regulations, it is not going to \n",
    "work.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. And let me assure you, sir, and I said this in \n",
    "the Senate hearing 2 weeks ago as well, our remit is just about \n",
    "those public companies. It is not the private companies in your \n",
    "district. My dad had a very small company, too. That is not the \n",
    "remit of the SEC.\n",
    "    Mr. Williams of Texas. Okay. The SEC&#x27;s rulemaking process \n",
    "is unprecedented, proposing over 50 rulemakings since the \n",
    "spring of 2021. The SEC has failed to understand the impact of \n",
    "these rules and how they will each affect the industry, as well \n",
    "as the aggregate amount of impact. It is crucial that the SEC \n",
    "conduct cost-benefit analysis, and solicit industry feedback of \n",
    "these proposals and what it will cost for the participants that \n",
    "the Commission oversees. I was proud to sign on to a letter led \n",
    "by Chairman McHenry to you highlighting our concerns with the \n",
    "rulemaking agenda in substantial volume. It is vital that the \n",
    "SEC understands the regulatory and financial burdens that they \n",
    "are unjustly placing on market participants, just like we \n",
    "talked about.\n",
    "    In closing, Chair Gensler, has the SEC engaged in any \n",
    "roundtables, field hearings, or investor testing to really \n",
    "solicit feedback before rulemaking?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Again, it was good to read your letter at \n",
    "about 8:00 p.m. last night. It was a good letter. But in terms \n",
    "of your question, we solicit feedback in the formal way through \n",
    "the comment period. We solicit feedback and have hundreds of \n",
    "meetings sometimes on any one rule with market participants, \n",
    "and then we detail them in the files, and we benefit from that \n",
    "feedback.\n",
    "    Mr. Williams of Texas. Thank you. I yield back.\n",
    "    Mrs. Wagner. The gentleman yields back. The Chair now \n",
    "recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Vargas, for 5 \n",
    "minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Vargas. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, and I want to \n",
    "thank the chairman and the ranking member for giving me the \n",
    "opportunity to speak. And I want to say, Chairman Gensler, it \n",
    "is good to see you, but I have to say it is even better to see \n",
    "Chairman Lucas. Chairman Lucas was the chairman of the \n",
    "Agriculture Committee when I first came to Congress 11 years \n",
    "ago. He was eminently fair and a good person to work with. And \n",
    "we have an 1,800-pound bull on our property, on our ranch, and \n",
    "I have to tell you, don&#x27;t mess with those animals. Those are \n",
    "big animals. They can do a lot of damage. So, it is great to \n",
    "see him here today. Like I said, I think everyone on this \n",
    "committee has great respect for him.\n",
    "    But it is great to see you here. You were asked somewhat of \n",
    "a Catch-22 question earlier, and that was you were supposed to \n",
    "produce some documents. And within those documents was a letter \n",
    "that was given to you by this committee, and then in that \n",
    "situation, it is either you disclose that letter is in there \n",
    "and they say, ha, you disclosed the letter that we sent you, \n",
    "how typical, or if you didn&#x27;t, he would say, boy, he didn&#x27;t \n",
    "even disclose the letter that we sent him. So, you were sort of \n",
    "caught in a Catch-22 no matter which way you answered. I am \n",
    "glad you disclosed the letter.\n",
    "    But then you were asked, I think, a very ugly and \n",
    "unfortunate question about a recent Senator and your \n",
    "interactions with him, because he has been indicted. I think \n",
    "there was an insinuation there that something that you did was \n",
    "inappropriate or improper. Could you comment on that, please?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I can&#x27;t comment about a criminal prosecution.\n",
    "    Mr. Vargas. No, not about the criminal prosecution, but the \n",
    "insinuation that you possibly did something that was \n",
    "inappropriate in your conversation with him on the phone.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. No. I didn&#x27;t discuss anything with the Senator \n",
    "in May of 2021, except for his concerns about Federal \n",
    "securities laws and disclosure, if I recall, but there might \n",
    "have been other topics that he talked about around disclosure, \n",
    "around diversity by investment advisers.\n",
    "    Mr. Vargas. Yes. I just wanted to give you an opportunity \n",
    "to say that because, again, I think that was a bit of an unfair \n",
    "question.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. In a role like mine, I engage with Senators \n",
    "and Members of the House of Representatives, and we benefit \n",
    "from those engagements.\n",
    "    Mr. Vargas. No, I agree, but, again, thank you for being \n",
    "here, and thank you for answering that question. Now, I take a \n",
    "very different view of climate-related risks, of course, on \n",
    "this side, and I think it is one of the biggest issues that we \n",
    "face as a world and certainly as a country. And the reasonable \n",
    "standard, again, was created by Thurgood Marshall, and that is, \n",
    "on materiality, what would a reasonable person want to know? \n",
    "And it seems to me with all the headlines that we have and all \n",
    "the information that we have about climate-related risks, and I \n",
    "could go through a whole bunch of headlines here, which I \n",
    "won&#x27;t, but it seems to be that this is a gigantic issue, and \n",
    "people want to know, and, in fact, people do want to know, and \n",
    "companies have been disclosing this for a while, so I think you \n",
    "are on the right track. But you are not a climate change \n",
    "organization, are you? You are not the cop on the beat for \n",
    "that?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. No, no, we are a securities regulator and a \n",
    "disclosure-based regulator, and that is what we are trying to \n",
    "do here. As I have often said, investors are making decisions \n",
    "today about public companies based on their climate risk \n",
    "disclosures, and it is trying to ensure that it is truthful, it \n",
    "is accurate, and it is decision-useful.\n",
    "    Mr. Vargas. Yes, and, in fact, this is what people want to \n",
    "know today, isn&#x27;t it? Any investor today who reads the \n",
    "newspaper, especially if they are invested in insurance or a \n",
    "company like that, they say, well, why isn&#x27;t my company \n",
    "insuring in California or along the areas in Florida that get \n",
    "swamped all the time with these huge hurricanes, and it is \n",
    "because of climate change.\n",
    "    We used to have climate deniers who said, no, we have the \n",
    "scientists who say that climate change isn&#x27;t real. Now, \n",
    "basically, all of the scientists agree. Then, you have some \n",
    "knuckleheaded column writers who say this isn&#x27;t true, but they \n",
    "are not scientists. Pure scientists don&#x27;t dispute it anymore, \n",
    "and it is real, and it is a big deal. And I am glad you are \n",
    "looking into it because investors want to know about this, \n",
    "especially long-term investors.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I would say from the SEC&#x27;s perspective, it is \n",
    "about whether investors are making investment decisions and \n",
    "find it material, as you mentioned, the Supreme Court, the law \n",
    "of the land, that a substantial likelihood that a reasonable \n",
    "investor finds it significant in the total mix of information, \n",
    "and that is what we know to be the case today. If 80-plus \n",
    "percent of the top 1,000 companies are making some climate risk \n",
    "disclosures, they are not all making Scope 3.\n",
    "    Mr. Vargas. Right.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We had lively discussions about that, but in \n",
    "terms of climate risks, a lot of companies are making \n",
    "disclosures already.\n",
    "    Mr. Vargas. Thank you again for being here. My time is up, \n",
    "so in my last 7 seconds, I thank the Chair again. Thank you, \n",
    "Mr. Chairman.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman \n",
    "from Minnesota, the Whip, Mr. Emmer, is now recognized for 5 \n",
    "minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Emmer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chair Gensler, I have a \n",
    "series of questions that require a yes-or-no answer, and in the \n",
    "interest of my limited time, I would appreciate it if you would \n",
    "comply with that.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler, is it fair to say generally that large \n",
    "institutions in any given industry benefit more from regulatory \n",
    "uncertainty than everyday market participants or smaller \n",
    "institutions which don&#x27;t have the scale or the capital to fund \n",
    "expensive compliance teams?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Large institutions could benefit from \n",
    "uncertainty.\n",
    "    Mr. Emmer. Reclaiming my time, the answer is, ``yes,&#x27;&#x27; sir. \n",
    "Mr. Gensler, you had an 18-year career at Goldman Sachs where \n",
    "you were partner and co-head of finance, correct?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Yes, sir.\n",
    "    Mr. Emmer. Thank you. And is it correct to say that you \n",
    "made most of your personal wealth directly through your \n",
    "employment at this bank, Goldman Sachs?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I have done well since then, too, sir.\n",
    "    Mr. Emmer. I will take that as a, ``yes,&#x27;&#x27; as well. You \n",
    "describe the SEC under your leadership as the cop on the beat \n",
    "watching out for our constituents, correct?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I think that is the mandate that Congress has \n",
    "given us.\n",
    "    Mr. Emmer. Reclaiming my time, the answer is, ``yes,&#x27;&#x27; sir. \n",
    "If you could just comply with what I have asked, I would \n",
    "appreciate it. But given your 18-year career at one of the \n",
    "biggest banks in the world and the personal financial fortune \n",
    "you amassed there, do you think it is possible for you to serve \n",
    "as an impartial regulator and not favor large financial \n",
    "intermediaries?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Absolutely, sir.\n",
    "    Mr. Emmer. Mr. Gensler, do you believe the vast majority of \n",
    "digital assets meet the investment contract test and are, \n",
    "therefore, securities operating illegally outside of the U.S. \n",
    "regulatory umbrella?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. As I have said, many of these assets, \n",
    "basically, the public is anticipating----\n",
    "    Mr. Emmer. Sir, is that a, ``yes?&#x27;&#x27;\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. ----profits based on the efforts of others.\n",
    "    Mr. Emmer. Is the answer then, ``yes?&#x27;&#x27;\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Again, without prejudging anyone, I do think \n",
    "that the significant majority are investment contracts.\n",
    "    Mr. Emmer. Reclaiming my time, I will take that as a, \n",
    "``yes.&#x27;&#x27; And to be clear, sir, this perspective has nothing to \n",
    "do with a concern you noted in a speech last year, where you \n",
    "said, ``Over the past year, several bank executives have shared \n",
    "their concerns with me about the sheer number of depositors who \n",
    "have moved money from their bank accounts into crypto-related \n",
    "exchanges and wallets,&#x27;&#x27; right?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. The concern that those bank executives raised \n",
    "was that those customers----\n",
    "    Mr. Emmer. Again, I am reclaiming my time, sir.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. ----were getting hurt.\n",
    "    Mr. Emmer. No. I have asked you to answer the question as \n",
    "briefly as possible so I can I can use the time I have, and it \n",
    "is clear that you would like to avoid answering the question, \n",
    "in my opinion. An Obama-appointed judge in the Southern \n",
    "District of New York, a bank-friendly jurisdiction where you \n",
    "bring most of your cases, recently found that decentralized \n",
    "financial technology, ``not only removes the so-called \n",
    "middlemen from these transactions, but it also allows users to \n",
    "interact through a variety of methods in an easy and efficient \n",
    "manner.&#x27;&#x27; The court also said underwriters, like the ones at \n",
    "banks where you work, sir, are, ``precisely the types of \n",
    "individual roles that decentralized exchanges were designed to \n",
    "eliminate.&#x27;&#x27;\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler, can you assure this committee that your style \n",
    "of regulation by harassment towards digital assets innovation \n",
    "is for the benefit of every American and not driven by your \n",
    "desire to protect industry incumbents?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. This is a field that is rife with fraud and \n",
    "manipulation, and I am looking out for the American investors \n",
    "who have been hurt by the crypto fraudsters and scammers.\n",
    "    Mr. Emmer. I will reclaim my time. Mr. Gensler, despite \n",
    "your years of rhetoric, like today, I am convinced you are not \n",
    "an impartial regulator. Instead, it is clear that you are \n",
    "working to consolidate your own power, even though it means \n",
    "crushing opportunities for everyday Americans, and, frankly, \n",
    "the financial future of this country. Even the Federal courts \n",
    "are highlighting the damage you, sir, are doing to our \n",
    "constituents, and they are telling you that you don&#x27;t have the \n",
    "legal authority to accomplish your goal of squashing \n",
    "competition in the financial markets. Congress has been telling \n",
    "you that, too.\n",
    "    Now, Mr. Gensler, I believe our great financial system is \n",
    "the definition of freedom in this country, and congressional \n",
    "policies must provide room for the traditional financial system \n",
    "to evolve alongside the disruptive digital asset ecosystem. \n",
    "That said, it cannot be understated that a common theme \n",
    "throughout your career, sir, is your relentless loyalty to the \n",
    "largest financial institutions at the clear expense of \n",
    "innovation, competition, and everyday Americans. I yield back.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I suspect some large financial institutions \n",
    "would not agree with that.\n",
    "    Mr. Emmer. There is no question now, sir. I have yielded \n",
    "back my time.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman \n",
    "from New Jersey, Mr. Gottheimer, is recognized for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Gottheimer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Chairman \n",
    "Gensler, L&#x27;Shana Tovah. It is good to see you.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. L&#x27;Shana Tovah. May this year bring you health \n",
    "and happiness.\n",
    "    Mr. Gottheimer. You, too, sir. If I can begin, in your \n",
    "testimony, you said that it generally takes 12 to 24 months for \n",
    "the SEC to proceed from issuing a new rule proposal to adopting \n",
    "it as a final rule. That may seem like a long time, but I \n",
    "assure you it is not a very long time for some of the smaller \n",
    "stakeholders that I speak to, who are spending so much of their \n",
    "time and resources in running their business and trying to \n",
    "compete. And, of course, I am getting concerned, and I wanted \n",
    "to get your thoughts on this as well. Are you worried that all \n",
    "these rules are putting small and mid-sized businesses at a \n",
    "disadvantage and inadvertently benefiting the larger ones that \n",
    "can better handle the deluge of all the proposals? Is there an \n",
    "unintended consequence of actually limiting the flow of capital \n",
    "to small and mid-sized businesses and favoring the larger ones?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We have talked about this in your office as \n",
    "well. I think that we benefit from hearing from the small \n",
    "businesses. We often then look to adjust the rules based on \n",
    "those comments, and also, if the rule is adopted, the \n",
    "implementation and compliance dates, and sometimes we stage \n",
    "that, whether it is over 12 to 24 months after a rule is \n",
    "adopted.\n",
    "    Mr. Gottheimer. Part of my concern is, and I appreciate \n",
    "there are ongoing discussions on this front, by my count, you \n",
    "have issued 50 separate rules, and there are another 14 new \n",
    "rules on your most recent unified agenda that are scheduled to \n",
    "be proposed in the coming months. And I was just trying to \n",
    "figure out the volume, what this means for the smaller \n",
    "stakeholders who just don&#x27;t have the regulatory backend to \n",
    "engage with the SEC and don&#x27;t know how to engage with the SEC \n",
    "in some ways. What do you think about that? How are you trying \n",
    "to shape the agency to really allow for them to also have a \n",
    "fair shot at the comment period?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. In part, by putting out the agenda itself 2\\1/\n",
    "2\\ years ago. We have now proposed the bulk of that. We take \n",
    "meetings even after comment periods all the way up to sometimes \n",
    "a few weeks before we adopt so they can keep engaging with us, \n",
    "and certainly, if there is not a shutdown, we are here. We are \n",
    "ready to take those meetings.\n",
    "    Mr. Gottheimer. Yes. You should know, just some feedback, \n",
    "that they often feel they don&#x27;t know how to come into the \n",
    "agency, how to utilize the agency, and that it can be \n",
    "intimidating. Especially if you are a smaller player, you just \n",
    "don&#x27;t know really how to do it, and they don&#x27;t have these big \n",
    "regulatory teams.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I would say that sometimes those are the best \n",
    "meetings. They are not necessarily the meetings that show up on \n",
    "the calendar as much, but they really are very helpful to hear \n",
    "from those smaller asset managers, those smaller broker-\n",
    "dealers, or public companies.\n",
    "    Mr. Gottheimer. I would like to shift gears to digital \n",
    "assets. In July, I was proud that this committee passed \n",
    "comprehensive digital asset legislation, bipartisan, including \n",
    "my amendment directing the SEC and the CFTC to do a joint \n",
    "rulemaking, creating a process for delisting an asset. Since \n",
    "2019, I have said that clear rules of the road for digital \n",
    "asset firms are critical to protect consumers and promote \n",
    "innovation here in the United States. You have claimed that you \n",
    "have all the authority you need, but a rulemaking process \n",
    "hasn&#x27;t started yet. Can you explain to us why, please?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Because there are already laws and rules on \n",
    "the books that apply to cryptosecurity tokens like they apply \n",
    "to others. There is nothing incompatible because you are \n",
    "storing something of value on a blockchain ledger. We talked \n",
    "earlier about being technology-neutral. Whether you are storing \n",
    "that at DTCC, the public clearinghouse, or you are storing it \n",
    "on an accounting ledger called blockchain, it is still a \n",
    "transfer of value, and the public is maybe depending on the \n",
    "token, anticipating a profit based on the efforts of others. As \n",
    "it relates to the so-called crypto exchanges, they are doing \n",
    "what we wouldn&#x27;t even allow anywhere else. They are \n",
    "commingling, co-bundling, trading against the public, and \n",
    "sometimes front-running the public on their platforms.\n",
    "    Mr. Gottheimer. Memorandums of understanding (MOUs) have \n",
    "long been used and adopted in a number of contexts. In June \n",
    "2022, you told the Financial Times that you are working on an \n",
    "MOU with the CFTC to avoid regulatory gaps for crypto. Can you \n",
    "give us an update on the status of the MOU, please?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I was hopeful that we would do something \n",
    "there, but what we do, on a case-by-case basis and an issue-by-\n",
    "issue basis work, is with the Commodity Futures Trading \n",
    "Commission with regard to this crypto field. They have \n",
    "important authorities. They execute against those authorities. \n",
    "We do against our authorities, really both with the same goal \n",
    "of protecting the public.\n",
    "    Mr. Gottheimer. Thank you. May you have a sweet New Year. \n",
    "Thank you. I yield back.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. The \n",
    "gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Huizenga, is recognized for 5 \n",
    "minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Huizenga. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and it&#x27;s good to be \n",
    "back. I was out of order here because I was in a bipartisan \n",
    "meeting with the Speaker talking about a debt commission, and I \n",
    "hope that is going to be part of the path forward that we are \n",
    "dealing with for government funding and our long-term debt. But \n",
    "I want to move quickly.\n",
    "    I want to follow up on some of Chairman McHenry&#x27;s questions \n",
    "and remarks, and I am not going to belabor the whole situation, \n",
    "where the public documents that you have given us on our \n",
    "request that has been out there for over 7 months, with no real \n",
    "information except for that which was already available through \n",
    "Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests by the public. Our \n",
    "request simply seeks to obtain information to better understand \n",
    "the black box of the SEC&#x27;s activities on climate-related \n",
    "measures and its rulemaking authority, and you had said in your \n",
    "own remarks, ``based on authorities granted by Congress.&#x27;&#x27; \n",
    "Well, I dispute the assertion that you have been granted that \n",
    "authority in this particular case, and we are a co-equal branch \n",
    "of government, and this is routine congressional oversight.\n",
    "    Let&#x27;s talk a little bit about the Commission vote for the \n",
    "climate request. When Chair McHenry asked if you have scheduled \n",
    "a vote for the Commission, I did not hear an answer on that or \n",
    "when a vote will be scheduled. I did not hear an answer on \n",
    "that. There are 13,000 emails and documents we have been told \n",
    "are ready to be produced but are being held up by a provision \n",
    "within the Exchange Act that requires a vote of the SEC \n",
    "Commissioners, is your assertion or the Commission&#x27;s assertion. \n",
    "Lawyers differ on that, and it is my understanding that you \n",
    "claim that you don&#x27;t have the votes necessary on the \n",
    "Commission, but Mr. Gensler, I want to ask you this: Are you \n",
    "personally ready to vote, ``yes,&#x27;&#x27; to produce these documents \n",
    "to this committee?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We continue to work with your staff. We have \n",
    "voted as a Commission on the, I think they are called \n",
    "transcribed interviews of----\n",
    "    Mr. Huizenga. The transcribed interviews are very different \n",
    "than the documents that we have requested. I am not asking you \n",
    "about the Commission. Are you voting, ``yes,&#x27;&#x27; and will you \n",
    "vote, ``yes,&#x27;&#x27; on giving that information to our committee as \n",
    "requested?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Again, as I have said, I truly believe in the \n",
    "oversight of this committee and working with the committee \n",
    "and----\n",
    "    Mr. Huizenga. Yes or no?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. ----working with my fellow Commissioners, and \n",
    "we are----\n",
    "    Mr. Huizenga. I want to know what you are going to do, not \n",
    "speaking for anybody else. You.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Again----\n",
    "    Mr. Huizenga. Yes or no?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Sir, again, we are working through this at the \n",
    "Commission level and with your staff.\n",
    "    Mr. Huizenga. Come on. This is ridiculous. Okay. So, let&#x27;s \n",
    "assume your answer now is, ``no.&#x27;&#x27; What have you done to try to \n",
    "produce a vote of any sort? Are you talking to your fellow \n",
    "Commissioners? Are you asking them to vote for that?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We have ongoing discussions. We, of course, \n",
    "have to have it one-on-one because of the Government in the \n",
    "Sunshine Act.\n",
    "    Mr. Huizenga. Okay. Frankly, we have been pretty cloudy \n",
    "over here on the congressional side. You are fulfilling FOIA \n",
    "requests, but you will not give that same information to \n",
    "Congress. That is a problem. Under 24(c), the delegated \n",
    "authority by the Commission allows you to do those FOIA \n",
    "requests without a vote of the Commission. It seems to me that \n",
    "maybe we need to help you out. Does that seem reasonable? \n",
    "Because here is our problem, what happens if you never get the \n",
    "votes? What is your plan, to ignore Congress?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We are going to continue to work with you.\n",
    "    Mr. Huizenga. What is your plan, because we have a plan. \n",
    "The chairman outlined the plan, and it begins with a, ``P,&#x27;&#x27; \n",
    "and ends in, ``oxy,&#x27;&#x27; and it is not a fun word that any of us \n",
    "want to fulfill.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Again, we are continuing to work and trying to \n",
    "get you documents on a regular basis.\n",
    "    Mr. Huizenga. But you are not. You are giving us publicly-\n",
    "available documents. That is not the role of oversight. Are you \n",
    "open to legislation that would clarify that the SEC is not \n",
    "required to have a full Commission vote to comply with the \n",
    "requests from Congress or this committee?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Again, I would have to have staff look at the \n",
    "legislation. We would give technical assistance as we have \n",
    "given on other provisions of----\n",
    "    Mr. Huizenga. I am pretty sure we don&#x27;t need your technical \n",
    "assistance because so far, the technical assistance has gotten \n",
    "us nothing. I enthusiastically support the Chair&#x27;s discussion \n",
    "of using compulsory process, and it is shameful that you are \n",
    "hiding behind this 24(c) process and that the Commission is, \n",
    "and we are going to have to remedy that apparently based on \n",
    "your lack of cooperation. One last quick question: Did you ever \n",
    "receive a memorandum or agency document in writing assessing \n",
    "the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision on West Virginia v. EPA on the \n",
    "SEC&#x27;s rulemaking authority?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I know that we have had discussions. I don&#x27;t \n",
    "remember any memo.\n",
    "    Mr. Huizenga. I am going to ask you to follow up.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I have the Supreme Court&#x27;s----\n",
    "    Mr. Huizenga. My time has expired.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\n",
    "    Mr. Huizenga. We are going to have you follow up in \n",
    "writing.\n",
    "    And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Thank you.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Casten, \n",
    "is recognized for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Casten. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It&#x27;s nice to see you \n",
    "again, Chair Gensler. I want to talk about your climate \n",
    "disclosure rule. I know it surprises you that I want to talk \n",
    "about that, and I realize that with it coming out soon, we are \n",
    "not going to be able to get into specifics, but I do just want \n",
    "to expand a little bit.\n",
    "    You had mentioned to Mr. Cleaver that investors were asking \n",
    "for more clarity because of all of the voluntary disclosures \n",
    "that are out there, and I think, but I don&#x27;t want to be \n",
    "presumptuous, that there is some history there that I am hoping \n",
    "you can share, because I think in 2010, the SEC entered a draft \n",
    "that is sort of interpretive guidance regarding more voluntary \n",
    "disclosures. Can you clarify what happened between 2010, and 12 \n",
    "years later in March of 2022, when the SEC decided that it was \n",
    "necessary to provide some more disclosure, and specifically, if \n",
    "you can comment on what was industry asking you for?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. A lot changed in the 12 years particularly. \n",
    "Investors got more and more interested making investment \n",
    "decisions, and here in the U.S., companies responded. Their \n",
    "investor relations and their CFOs and corporate executives \n",
    "responded to meet those requests by investors, and they started \n",
    "following something that was called the Taskforce on Climate-\n",
    "related Disclosures (TCFD) framework. You are probably familiar \n",
    "with this international framework, which, interestingly, was 32 \n",
    "people who were mostly from industry. They weren&#x27;t from the \n",
    "government sector. And by 2021, 80-plus percent of the top \n",
    "1,000 companies were making some climate risk disclosures. That \n",
    "is what really changed--investor demand for investor decision-\n",
    "making--and that is where the SEC has a role.\n",
    "    Mr. Casten. I appreciate that. That certainly is consistent \n",
    "with my experience in the private sector, and I think it is sad \n",
    "that we need to keep reminding folks that this was really an \n",
    "industry-led initiative in the first instance. I want to move \n",
    "to the State level, because a little while ago you had \n",
    "mentioned to The Wall Street Journal that if California \n",
    "finalized some rules, I think you said, ``This may change some \n",
    "of the economic baseline of the Commission as it relates to the \n",
    "pending order.&#x27;&#x27; And of course, last month, the California \n",
    "legislature did pass a package of climate disclosure bills, \n",
    "which I understand only relate to companies beyond a certain \n",
    "size that do business in California. But given your earlier \n",
    "comments, can you speak to how, if at all, that is factoring \n",
    "into how you are thinking about the disclosure and whether you \n",
    "are still on pace for an October release, as you had earlier \n",
    "indicated?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We look at the economics very seriously, and \n",
    "that law that was passed in California is not yet signed. But \n",
    "if it were signed into law, as I understand it, that would \n",
    "require companies of a certain size to report on their climate \n",
    "risk, I think over half a billion dollars in revenues and those \n",
    "over a billion dollars in revenues to report greenhouse gas \n",
    "emissions, and for the listening public----\n",
    "    Mr. Casten. And on a Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 basis. \n",
    "That is what you are pointing at.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Yes, all three of these scopes, but for the \n",
    "listening public, it is estimated that somewhere between 1,400 \n",
    "and 1,500 public companies might need to report under that law. \n",
    "We have not confirmed that number. That is just an estimate \n",
    "that is in the press, and that may change the baseline. If \n",
    "those companies were reporting to California, then it would be, \n",
    "in essence, less costly because they have already been \n",
    "producing that information. It is also important, because the \n",
    "investing public is making decisions based on those public \n",
    "reports, that the reports are accurate, and that they are \n",
    "truthful, because the investing public benefits by making sure \n",
    "of the accuracy of the disclosures.\n",
    "    Mr. Casten. And you had indicated that you are targeting an \n",
    "October release date for the final rule. Are you still on that \n",
    "pace? Can you speak to that? And do California&#x27;s actions in any \n",
    "way change that?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Let me just put this a little in context. \n",
    "Twice a year, working with the Office of Management and Budget \n",
    "(OMB), we put out what is called a Unified Agenda, and we put \n",
    "dates on all of the proposals really and two different dates of \n",
    "the year, so I wouldn&#x27;t, with all due respect, put too much \n",
    "emphasis on that. With 16,000 comments, we have gone through it \n",
    "15, 16 months since we made the proposal. It tends to take, \n",
    "again, 12 to 24 months, but we are not doing this against the \n",
    "clock, but when the staff is ready, and when the Commission is \n",
    "ready.\n",
    "    Mr. Casten. Thank you. I have more questions, but I am out \n",
    "of time, so I yield back. Thank you again for being here.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman yields back. We will now go \n",
    "to the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Loudermilk, for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Loudermilk. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Gensler, \n",
    "thank you for being here.\n",
    "    Mr. Chairman, without objection, I would like to submit for \n",
    "the record a Wall Street Journal article by Warren Stephens and \n",
    "Paul Reilly, entitled, ``The SEC Wants to Spy on Your \n",
    "Portfolio.&#x27;&#x27;\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n",
    "    Mr. Loudermilk. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Gensler, \n",
    "as the op-ed points out, prior to the Consolidated Audit Trail, \n",
    "the government needed legal cause to force financial \n",
    "institutions to report their customers&#x27; personally identifiable \n",
    "information. In your opening statement, you refer to the SEC as \n",
    "the cop on the beat, but law enforcement has to comply with due \n",
    "process.\n",
    "    And I am concerned--no, I am convinced--that the \n",
    "Consolidated Audit Trail has the potential to become another \n",
    "warrantless surveillance program. And as we have all \n",
    "experienced, if you extend the government power, that power \n",
    "will inevitably be abused, as we saw with the FISA courts, \n",
    "especially if that power does not have direct oversight and \n",
    "control by Congress.\n",
    "    My first question, Mr. Gensler, is, have you read this \n",
    "article that just came out the other day in The Wall Street \n",
    "Journal about the Consolidated Audit Trail?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I may have. I feel like in the last 2 days, I \n",
    "saw the headlines.\n",
    "    Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. It goes on to explain the problems \n",
    "that I have laid out several times when you have been here \n",
    "before about the collecting of personally identifiable \n",
    "information and, quite frankly, a lot of information about \n",
    "individuals and their buying of stocks. In fact, when you were \n",
    "here last time, I believe that you expressed that the purpose \n",
    "of this is so you could peruse to look for any potential \n",
    "illegal activity. That is a blatant violation of the Fourth \n",
    "Amendment. That is what this article is spelling out, and it \n",
    "has gotten the attention of a lot of people, even outside the \n",
    "financial services arena. So I would encourage you to please \n",
    "read it, because I think it explains the concerns that many of \n",
    "us have about this program.\n",
    "    Also, Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit for the record a \n",
    "letter that was sent by me and my colleagues to Mr. Gensler----\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n",
    "    Mr. Loudermilk. ----regarding the Consolidated Audit Trail.\n",
    "    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Mr. Gensler, regarding this \n",
    "letter, in the letter, I ask about the 3,000 individuals, the \n",
    "estimated number of people or institutions that would have \n",
    "access to the Consolidated Audit Trail or the customer account \n",
    "information system, and 3,000 would have access to it. Who are \n",
    "these individuals, and how will they be vetted for access to \n",
    "such sensitive information?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. One, I will read the article that you \n",
    "mentioned. Two, in terms of individuals, this Consolidated \n",
    "Audit Trail is only allowed to be used at the SEC and by the \n",
    "self-regulatory organizations. At the SEC, it is our Division \n",
    "of Enforcement, our Division of Economic and Risk Analysis, and \n",
    "our Division of Trading and Markets.\n",
    "    Mr. Loudermilk. How are all these 3,000 individuals getting \n",
    "access to personally identifiable information and details about \n",
    "stock transactions by even just a factory worker who has a \n",
    "Robinhood account? What is the vetting process on this, and how \n",
    "are we going to ensure that they do not use this in violation \n",
    "of personal rights?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I just want to say I am not familiar with that \n",
    "number, but in terms of at the SEC, these are people who are \n",
    "dedicated public servants, who are full time at the agency, \n",
    "either in our Division of Enforcement, our Division of Economic \n",
    "and Risk Analysis, or our Division of Trading and Markets----\n",
    "    Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. Well, if you respond to the letter, \n",
    "that may be helpful, and I would like to move on because we are \n",
    "getting short on time. This is really just a yes-or-no \n",
    "question. Will the SEC use data collected via the Consolidated \n",
    "Audit Trail and the customer account information system to \n",
    "bring enforcement actions?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We have already, and we anticipate doing so in \n",
    "the future.\n",
    "    Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. Let me make sure I have this right. \n",
    "Well, let me ask you this. How has the Consolidated Audit Trail \n",
    "been funded? Is this being appropriated by Congress?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It is by industry funding.\n",
    "    Mr. Loudermilk. Okay. So, private industry is funding this. \n",
    "The cost of this has gone up exponentially since it started, \n",
    "but just to close out, I want to make sure I understand. You \n",
    "are saying that the Consolidated Audit Trail is a comprehensive \n",
    "database of transactions used for Federal enforcement purposes, \n",
    "but it is not subject to congressional oversight or through \n",
    "appropriations. This is lining up to be another surveillance \n",
    "program without any control, without any constraint, and \n",
    "without even the power of the purse. I yield back.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. We will \n",
    "now go to the gentleman from New York, Mr. Torres, for 5 \n",
    "minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Torres. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Gensler, good \n",
    "morning. I worry that the term, ``investment contract,&#x27;&#x27; has \n",
    "become so infinitely malleable and manipulable that it means \n",
    "whatever you unilaterally think it ought to mean, right? I \n",
    "worry that when it comes to crypto, your interpretation of the \n",
    "term, ``investment contract,&#x27;&#x27; has no limiting principle and, \n",
    "therefore, could invite arbitrary and capricious enforcement \n",
    "actions. So, I want to take a few minutes to explore the \n",
    "concept of investment contract in greater depth, and I want to \n",
    "start with an obvious definitional question. We know that an \n",
    "investment contract requires an investment. Does an investment \n",
    "contract require a contract?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I will quote Thurgood Marshall, ``Congress \n",
    "painted with a broad brush,&#x27;&#x27; and when Marshall said that, he \n",
    "was writing the law of the land. So, we follow this Howey Test \n",
    "and how, not just Marshall, but other courts interpreted it, \n",
    "and it has four components----\n",
    "    Mr. Torres. Again, I did not go to MIT, but in the Bronx, \n",
    "if I ask whether an investment contract includes a contract, \n",
    "the answer is typically either yes or no.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Actually, sir, under the Supreme Court law of \n",
    "the land, they do not write that in. They say it is an \n",
    "investment of money in a common enterprise, and you are \n",
    "anticipating profits based on the efforts of others. I took an \n",
    "oath to follow the law of the land, and that is the Supreme \n",
    "Court law of the land.\n",
    "    Mr. Torres. In Howey, the Supreme Court refers to an \n",
    "investment contract as a contract, scheme, or transaction. That \n",
    "was the terminology that I saw in the case. And as far as I can \n",
    "tell, there is nothing in the Supreme Court&#x27;s jurisprudence \n",
    "that suggests that a scheme or transaction means the absence of \n",
    "a contract. And by way of illustration, consider the landmark \n",
    "case of SEC v. Howey. In the Howey case, there was not a single \n",
    "contract, but there were two contracts: a land sales contract \n",
    "with the Howey Company; and a service contract with Howey-in-\n",
    "the-Hills. And the Court found that the combination of those \n",
    "two contracts, the total scheme, the total transaction, the \n",
    "total economic reality was constitutive of an investment \n",
    "contract, and so a scheme or a transaction does not mean the \n",
    "absence of any contract at all. It means as it did in Howey, a \n",
    "multiplicity of contracts.\n",
    "    In August, there were six law professors from law schools \n",
    "as preeminent as Yale who came to the following conclusion: \n",
    "``No decision of the Supreme Court has ever found that a scheme \n",
    "that does not involve a contract could qualify as an investment \n",
    "contract.&#x27;&#x27; Do you disagree with that statement, and if so, \n",
    "could you please cite a decision of the Supreme Court that has \n",
    "found an investment contract in the absence of an actual \n",
    "contract?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. The SEC has been in front of multiple courts, \n",
    "and investment contract has been----\n",
    "    Mr. Torres. What is the name of the case, Mr. Gensler, the \n",
    "Supreme Court case that has found an investment contract in the \n",
    "absence of an actual contract? Can you cite a case?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. The SEC over the decades, whether it is----\n",
    "    Mr. Torres. Can you cite a case?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. ----whiskey caskets, whether it is crypto, if \n",
    "the public is investing based upon the efforts of others----\n",
    "    Mr. Torres. I find it telling that you cannot cite a single \n",
    "case----\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. ----that is a security.\n",
    "    Mr. Torres. How about a Second Circuit case? Can you cite a \n",
    "single Second Circuit case that has found an investment \n",
    "contract in the absence of a contract?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I understand where you are trying to go, and I \n",
    "am going to leave that to the very fine attorneys at the SEC in \n",
    "front of courts, but I am saying the core principle is----\n",
    "    Mr. Torres. Mr. Gensler, let me finish.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. This is a field that is filling the pocket of \n",
    "the public.\n",
    "    Mr. Torres. This is a question to which you should know the \n",
    "answer because the definition of an investment contract is the \n",
    "central issue. That is what determines the extent of your \n",
    "authority, that is what determines the applicability of Federal \n",
    "securities law to crypto transactions, and your inability to \n",
    "answer that question is baffling to me.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I am answering it consistent with what the \n",
    "Supreme Court has said, which is the law of the land, is a \n",
    "four-part----\n",
    "    Mr. Torres. And yet, you cannot cite a single case to \n",
    "support your argument.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It is called Howey. It is called Reeves. It is \n",
    "called many cases at the Supreme Court, sir. Eight or nine \n",
    "times, it has been affirmed by the Supreme Court.\n",
    "    Mr. Torres. Suppose I were to purchase a Pokemon card. \n",
    "Would doing so constitute a security transaction?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. You could purchase a Pokemon card. I don&#x27;t \n",
    "know what the context is, but if you are purchasing a Pokemon \n",
    "card----\n",
    "    Mr. Torres. If I purchase a Pokemon card, is that a \n",
    "security transaction?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. ----at a retail store, that is not a security.\n",
    "    Mr. Torres. Okay. If I were to purchase a tokenized Pokemon \n",
    "card on a digital exchange via a blockchain, is that a security \n",
    "transaction?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I would have to know more.\n",
    "    Mr. Torres. Okay. So for you, the process of tokenization \n",
    "is what transforms a non-security transaction into a security \n",
    "transaction?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Look, if the investing public----\n",
    "    Mr. Torres. I thought you were technology-neutral.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. If the investing public is anticipating \n",
    "profits based upon the efforts of others and they are \n",
    "exchanging funds, that is the core----\n",
    "    Mr. Torres. I see my time has expired.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. We will \n",
    "now go to the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Davidson, for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Davidson. Chairman Gensler, recently a Federal court \n",
    "called your rejection of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), \n",
    "``arbitrary and capricious.&#x27;&#x27; In a subsequent interview, you \n",
    "dismissed the judge&#x27;s opinion. Asked a follow-up question, ``If \n",
    "anything a judge says would change your mind,&#x27;&#x27; you responded, \n",
    "``Well, no, not really.&#x27;&#x27; It seems that you don&#x27;t really \n",
    "recognize the authority of the Judicial Branch. You seem to \n",
    "have a love for the Howey Test selectively applied, as \n",
    "illustrated by Mr. Torres, but in light of those reactions, \n",
    "what should people think about the Bitcoin ETF? How will the \n",
    "SEC revise its approach?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We have great respect for the courts. I \n",
    "personally have great respect for the courts. We are \n",
    "considering that. It is still an act of consideration at the \n",
    "Commission, and we are familiar----\n",
    "    Mr. Davidson. So, you haven&#x27;t made up your mind.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. ----with the case.\n",
    "    Mr. Davidson. Yes. I have to tell you that many market \n",
    "participants have reached out and are concerned that you will \n",
    "arbitrarily, perhaps also capriciously, pull recent filings \n",
    "ahead of others who have been working with the SEC for years to \n",
    "get an approval for a Bitcoin spot ETF. Will this resemble some \n",
    "sort of free pass for one favored company while others remain \n",
    "locked out? And I ask that because it seems that has happened \n",
    "before at the SEC.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Sir, I am not sure if I am following. We are \n",
    "still considering that court case and the application, as you \n",
    "say, to Bitcoin exchange-traded products.\n",
    "    Mr. Davidson. Are you going to preserve people&#x27;s places in \n",
    "line, or are you going to pull ahead a favored transaction or \n",
    "another on the consideration of a Bitcoin spot ETF? Are you \n",
    "going to preserve the place in the queue? Because timing \n",
    "matters. People have worked on this for years, and then you get \n",
    "a recent filing by somebody big in the market, and it seems \n",
    "like, oh yes, let me take your calls. How can I help? \n",
    "Meanwhile, you have given the stiff arm, as I have said, Hotel \n",
    "California-style regulations, where you can check in with the \n",
    "SEC, but you can never leave with clarity. And how about the \n",
    "Legislative Branch? Do you recognize the authority of Congress \n",
    "or the laws that we pass?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Yes. We comply with the laws that Congress \n",
    "passes every day.\n",
    "    Mr. Davidson. I have heard you say that about the courts \n",
    "and now Congress, which is encouraging, but I am inclined to \n",
    "judge your deeds more than your words. And I will pick up where \n",
    "one of my colleagues, Mr. Huizenga, left off with the Supreme \n",
    "Court decision in West Virginia v. the EPA. Are you are \n",
    "familiar with that case?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Yes, sir, I am familiar with it. It is an \n",
    "important case.\n",
    "    Mr. Davidson. I&#x27;m glad to hear you say that, and it would \n",
    "be binding, correct?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It is the law of the land, sir.\n",
    "    Mr. Davidson. That is right, and it introduces the major \n",
    "questions doctrine. You told Mr. Barr that you received tons of \n",
    "feedback on your proposed ESG disclosure rules, feedback that \n",
    "should make it clear that the proposal for ESG disclosure is a \n",
    "major question, and it should make clear that you don&#x27;t have \n",
    "the legal authority to do that. So, I would ask you to knock it \n",
    "off, cease and desist, and work with this body to pass a law if \n",
    "you want to regulate something.\n",
    "    Frankly, your time as Chair has highlighted two problems: a \n",
    "Gary Gensler problem; and a structural flaw in the SEC. And as \n",
    "I told you in April, I proposed a solution called the SEC \n",
    "Stabilization Act. You are making the case for this bill easier \n",
    "every day. You are acting as the Chair by doing rulemaking \n",
    "after rulemaking without any regard to the impact of these \n",
    "rules, or maybe that is the feature for you, I don&#x27;t know, but \n",
    "it is having a massive impact on our markets. We have markets \n",
    "that truly are the envy of the world. Why would you disrupt \n",
    "them with processes that are driving capital out of our \n",
    "markets, not to avoid our laws, but to find some place where \n",
    "they can get clarity, where they can work with a regulator and \n",
    "get a decision and a path forward?\n",
    "    So instead of selectively applied, you are not providing \n",
    "clarity with a rule that is evenly applied. You are \n",
    "intentionally shortening comment periods to limit feedback, and \n",
    "the courts have even called this arbitrary and capricious. You \n",
    "are pushing a woke political and social agenda, and, I think, \n",
    "abusing your role in the authority of the SEC as cover. I \n",
    "think, fundamentally, the SEC Stabilization Act would remove \n",
    "the role of Chair. It would preserve the current Commissioners, \n",
    "and we would add a sixth Commissioner, so there would be no \n",
    "more than three from any one political party, and that would \n",
    "provide a path that would make the SEC do what you are \n",
    "avoiding. Frankly, you are front-running Congress, you are \n",
    "front-running the courts, you are front-running even the \n",
    "Administration, and no one has held you to account for that. I \n",
    "wish the Biden Administration would say, you are fired, but the \n",
    "list of folks they need to do that for is long. Congress \n",
    "hopefully will with the SEC Stabilization Act. I yield back.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. We will \n",
    "now recognize the gentleman from Nevada, Mr. Horsford, for 5 \n",
    "minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Horsford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the \n",
    "ranking member for the hearing, and to Chair Gensler for being \n",
    "here. While investor protection remains paramount for my \n",
    "colleagues and myself, it should not be lost on anyone here \n",
    "that the largest risk our investing public is exposed to at \n",
    "this moment is the risk of a government shutdown. We hear time \n",
    "and again in this committee that our capital markets are the \n",
    "deepest and most efficient in the world, and yet, a large part \n",
    "of why they were able to reach their presently-enjoyed imminent \n",
    "status is because investors around the globe have confidence \n",
    "that the SEC has the power necessary to maintain fair and \n",
    "orderly markets.\n",
    "    Without proper funding in place, the SEC cannot carry out \n",
    "that critical investor protection mandate, and I fear that as \n",
    "funding disruptions become increasingly more common, we risk \n",
    "losing the world&#x27;s confidence. And I will continue working \n",
    "earnestly with my colleagues to avoid a counterproductive MAGA \n",
    "Republican-inflicted government shutdown, but I ask all of my \n",
    "colleagues to consider the far-reaching consequences of this \n",
    "short-sighted path.\n",
    "    Chairman Gensler, when we last spoke, I raised concerns \n",
    "regarding the open-end fund liquidity rule, and I appreciated \n",
    "your willingness to consider that the vast majority of my \n",
    "constituents do the bulk of their investing through their \n",
    "retirement plans. These hardworking Nevadans should not be at \n",
    "risk of losing out on today&#x27;s price simply because they live on \n",
    "the West Coast.\n",
    "    Chairman Gensler, as the SEC continues to evaluate its \n",
    "economic analysis for the open-end fund liquidity proposal, \n",
    "what have you been able to ascertain about the disparate impact \n",
    "for investors based on geographic location?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It has been raised by you, and it has also \n",
    "been raised by members of the public.\n",
    "    Mr. Horsford. Have you resolved it in the rule? And I only \n",
    "have 3 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. No, I appreciate it. I am not trying to \n",
    "prejudge where we will end up. The overall rule had three key \n",
    "parts. You are focused on one, which is what was called the \n",
    "close or hard close, but there are two other really important \n",
    "parts, liquidity, just what is the liquidity behind----\n",
    "    Mr. Horsford. So, will the geographic location be factored \n",
    "in your final rule? Yes or no?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It is an aspect of it. All funds today close \n",
    "at 4:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, so it is already----\n",
    "    Mr. Horsford. Which disproportionally impacts Nevadans and \n",
    "people on the West Coast. So, I am going to keep pressing the \n",
    "issue until you understand that it is a disparate impact on \n",
    "those of us who live on the West Coast, and Nevadans should not \n",
    "be treated unfairly because of where they live. That needs to \n",
    "be factored into the final rule.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. No, I agree, sir.\n",
    "    Mr. Horsford. Chairman Gensler, as Mr. Meeks pointed out \n",
    "earlier, minority- and women-owned firms still tend to be \n",
    "smaller, as they work to overcome their traditional \n",
    "underinvestment and lack of working capital. As you heard \n",
    "previously, these smaller, more-diverse firms will have more \n",
    "difficulty complying with the new disclosures required and will \n",
    "have less ability to absorb the cost associated with doing so.\n",
    "    Earlier, you had begun discussing the expanded analysis the \n",
    "SEC made for the disproportionate impact on diverse and women-\n",
    "owned funds when the Commission considered the private fund \n",
    "adviser rule. Would you be able to expand upon your earlier \n",
    "answer that these funds were included in the analysis of small \n",
    "business, and give us any specifics that your team found on the \n",
    "potential impacts on these funds?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I would be happy to have staff follow up with \n",
    "the actual pages and the parts of the economic analysis, but it \n",
    "was considered as part of the effects on small investment \n",
    "advisers, including women- and minority-held firms.\n",
    "    Mr. Horsford. The issue of waning diversity in our equity \n",
    "markets is of great concern and we must be careful about adding \n",
    "any additional burdens on these small firms. I look forward to \n",
    "working with the SEC specifically on this issue. As I said, it \n",
    "is a wider issue, Mr. Chairman, and I worry that at a time when \n",
    "attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, not, \n",
    "``woke,&#x27;&#x27; like my colleague just referred to--the next time \n",
    "someone uses that word, would you define what you mean by it, \n",
    "because to me, it means anti-diversity. It means anti-\n",
    "inclusion, and if that is what you stand for, then you don&#x27;t \n",
    "represent me or my constituents.\n",
    "    We are working hard to hold the line. There is nothing in \n",
    "any court decision by the Supreme Court or anywhere else that \n",
    "should quell the private sector&#x27;s commitment to diversity, \n",
    "equity, and inclusion. We must use every tool available to us \n",
    "to not only bring new entrants into the financial system, but \n",
    "to also promote their successes----\n",
    "    Mr. Meuser. [presiding]. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\n",
    "    Mr. Horsford. ----within our financial institutions as \n",
    "well. I will yield back at this time.\n",
    "    Mr. Meuser. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from \n",
    "Tennessee, Mr. Rose, is now recognized for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Rose. Thank you, and thank you, Chair Gensler, for \n",
    "taking the time to leave your virtual office in Maryland to \n",
    "attend today&#x27;s hearing, and I was also glad to see that you \n",
    "held an in-person, open meeting last week for, I think, the \n",
    "first time during your chairmanship. I say that because, Chair \n",
    "Gensler, you are rarely in the office and conduct most of your \n",
    "meetings from the comfort of your home, and what I wonder is, \n",
    "how can we be sure of whom you are meeting with on a daily \n",
    "basis? If perhaps someone from Better Markets comes over for \n",
    "dinner to discuss, ``Europeanizing,&#x27;&#x27; our U.S. capital markets, \n",
    "would that be logged and made publicly available on your \n",
    "calendar?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I haven&#x27;t had any of those dinners, but \n",
    "hypothetically, if I had that dinner, it would be logged.\n",
    "    Mr. Rose. I hope so, and I am glad to hear that. Chair \n",
    "Gensler, in your written testimony, you state that, ``We also \n",
    "have finalized 24 rulemakings, nearly all of which have changed \n",
    "based on public feedback.&#x27;&#x27; Approximately how many hours per \n",
    "week do you personally spend reading public comments submitted \n",
    "to the unprecedented number of proposed rulemakings issued by \n",
    "the SEC?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I work a lot of hours during the week. My kids \n",
    "are grown and out of the house, and my girlfriend lives in a \n",
    "different city, so I don&#x27;t know how it breaks down. I usually \n",
    "get summaries of the comments. If they are from a Member of \n",
    "Congress, I read all of the Members of Congress&#x27; comments \n",
    "personally, but then I get examples in each of the rulemakings, \n",
    "a handful on each of the issues.\n",
    "    Mr. Rose. I am glad to hear that as well. Chair Gensler, in \n",
    "May, I co-led a bipartisan letter to you, along with my \n",
    "colleague, Jennifer Wexton, and 22 of our colleagues, regarding \n",
    "troubling accusations that the China-backed fast-fashion \n",
    "retailer, Shein, allegedly engages in human rights violations, \n",
    "including utilizing materials that may have been made using \n",
    "Uyghur forced labor. Do you believe that Shein should be \n",
    "required to certify via independent verification that the \n",
    "company does not use Uyghur forced labor as a condition of \n",
    "being registered to issue securities in the United States?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. If I might step away from one registrant and \n",
    "go a little broader, Congress passed a law--the Uyghur Forced \n",
    "Labor Act, I think was the name--and that is the law of the \n",
    "land. The staff put out guidance earlier this year to all \n",
    "public registrants that they have to speak to if they are in \n",
    "compliance with that Act of Congress. Again, materiality \n",
    "matters, and we have been very clear with that with individual \n",
    "registrants in their filings, and our Division of Corporation \n",
    "Finance makes that abundantly clear in each of those registrant \n",
    "discussions.\n",
    "    Mr. Rose. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent \n",
    "to have the text of that letter entered into the record.\n",
    "    Mr. Meuser. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n",
    "    Mr. Rose. Chair Gensler, regarding cryptocurrencies and \n",
    "shifting gears, I am interested in why you have pursued a \n",
    "litigation-heavy strategy, despite the fact that neither you \n",
    "nor any of your senior staff are litigators, neither your Chief \n",
    "of Staff nor your Policy Director or even your General Counsel. \n",
    "Why have you settled on such a litigation-heavy strategy to \n",
    "address the cryptocurrency market?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Frankly, it is because the field is so rife \n",
    "with hucksters and fraudsters and non-compliant parties. But we \n",
    "have also done rulemakings, one related to broker-dealers that \n",
    "was completed a number of years ago, and then others related to \n",
    "the definition of, ``exchange,&#x27;&#x27; and the custody role that has \n",
    "been discussed a bit here, and even something called best \n",
    "execution. But this is a field where the American public is at \n",
    "risk and being harmed every day on these platforms that are \n",
    "commingling and often trading against their customers.\n",
    "    Mr. Rose. In my view, it seems that these cases are brought \n",
    "with an explicit political agenda, not a substantive legal one.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Nothing could be further from the truth. The \n",
    "only thing political is protecting the American public, which I \n",
    "think Members of both sides of the aisle will probably agree \n",
    "with; they don&#x27;t want to see constituents hurt, and in a place \n",
    "where a lot of crypto projects are not properly disclosing, \n",
    "there have been too many bankruptcies, and in the bankruptcies, \n",
    "investors are just lining up at the bankruptcy court.\n",
    "    Mr. Rose. Thank you. In my opinion, I would like to see you \n",
    "do more from the regulatory and guidance side----\n",
    "    Mr. Meuser. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\n",
    "    Mr. Rose. ----because this industry is so important, and we \n",
    "need to foster it, in my view. Thank you, and I yield back.\n",
    "    Mr. Meuser. The gentleman yields back. The gentlewoman from \n",
    "Michigan, Ms. Tlaib, is now recognized for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Ms. Tlaib. Thank you. And thank you, Chair Gensler, for \n",
    "being here. I know that you have been pretty public about or \n",
    "maybe you made an argument or took a position that it is too \n",
    "costly for firms if the SEC establishes a robust climate \n",
    "disclosure rule. Is that correct?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. There are many comments in our comment file \n",
    "that have raised that, and that is what I am talking about \n",
    "because we, under the Administrative Procedure Act, have to \n",
    "take all of those comments----\n",
    "    Ms. Tlaib. I understand.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. ----and do an economic analysis that takes \n",
    "into consideration the cost.\n",
    "    Ms. Tlaib. In those comments, I think about 1,000 companies \n",
    "have already voluntarily reported emissions from their \n",
    "customers and suppliers. We call it Scope 3 emissions, as you \n",
    "know, where most of the firms&#x27; greenhouse gas emissions can \n",
    "originate. On top of that, we also are now seeing that \n",
    "thousands of additional U.S. companies will soon be required to \n",
    "report Scope 3 emissions to comply with the EU standards. And \n",
    "California, I think, just passed a bill that would require \n",
    "roughly 5,000 public and private companies to report Scope 3 \n",
    "emissions, correct?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Yes, I believe both Europe, and if the \n",
    "governor signs the law in California, that will be the case, \n",
    "and it will change the economics because, in essence, it \n",
    "changes the baseline----\n",
    "    Ms. Tlaib. Just looking at those moves by California, of \n",
    "course, and the EU&#x27;s Scope 3 emissions disclosures, would it \n",
    "undermine the argument that such reporting will be overly \n",
    "burdensome if required by SEC?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. While it may change the economics over the \n",
    "course of the years, California&#x27;s rule wouldn&#x27;t be in place \n",
    "until 2027, I believe. The SEC still has to stay within our \n",
    "remit and the laws as Congress has passed, and it is about \n",
    "investor decisions and what is being disclosed.\n",
    "    Ms. Tlaib. Sure. If I may, Mr. Chairman, I would like to \n",
    "submit for the record a letter signed by 25 of my colleagues \n",
    "from the House and the Senate, urging you, Chair Gensler, to \n",
    "finalize a robust climate disclosure rule that includes Scope 3 \n",
    "emissions.\n",
    "    Mr. Meuser. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n",
    "    Ms. Tlaib. It is pretty simple why we need a robust \n",
    "disclosure rule, Chair Gensler. At least, it is simple for me. \n",
    "I know this is what you do every day, but I think the impact on \n",
    "the ground for my family is pretty clear. Currently, U.S. \n",
    "companies can and do obscure their exposure to climate risks, \n",
    "as you probably already know, and threaten the investments that \n",
    "retirees and workers depend on. For example, you look at \n",
    "Brookfield Renewable, an affiliate of a giant asset manager, \n",
    "and Brookfield describes itself as, ``one of the world&#x27;s \n",
    "largest publicly-traded, pure play, renewable power \n",
    "platforms.&#x27;&#x27; That sounds like a choice that would avoid \n",
    "climate-related financial risks, right? Wrong. A recent report \n",
    "found that Brookfield Renewable has invested in a fund that \n",
    "holds fossil fuel infrastructure assets, including Alberta oil \n",
    "sands&#x27; pipelines, which the firm does not disclose in its SEC \n",
    "filings.\n",
    "    This is just one example among many, Chair Gensler, of \n",
    "financial greenwashing which regularly involves emission of \n",
    "Scope 3 emissions. So again, I really think such practices \n",
    "jeopardize the hard-earned life savings of many of my residents \n",
    "and of workers across our country, retirees who invest paycheck \n",
    "after paycheck year after year to secure their financial \n",
    "future. So just please know, and I want to be on record that I \n",
    "really would urge you to move forward on having a robust \n",
    "disclosure rule, but with that, Mr. Chairman, I would like to \n",
    "yield the rest of my time to Mr. Foster.\n",
    "    [Chart]\n",
    "    Mr. Foster. Thank you. I just have a quick question. I take \n",
    "it that you are familiar with this graphic from Bloomberg that \n",
    "shows you lagging significantly behind your three predecessors \n",
    "in terms of the number of rules you finalized in the first 2 \n",
    "years of your tenure?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I did read that in Bloomberg Law 2 weeks ago.\n",
    "    Mr. Foster. Okay. Now, when your Republican predecessor, \n",
    "Harvey Pitt, finalized 34 rules in his first 2 years and 4 \n",
    "months, I guess, was that preceded by the sort of detailed \n",
    "cost-benefit analysis of all the possible interplays between \n",
    "all of these rules that our Republican colleagues are asking \n",
    "for?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It included cost-benefit, but we benefit \n",
    "from----\n",
    "    Mr. Foster. But the interplay between the 34 rules, which \n",
    "now is apparently the bar.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Oh, thank you. As best I understand it, they \n",
    "did it rule by rule, individually.\n",
    "    Mr. Foster. Individual, yes. And when Mary Shapiro did 28, \n",
    "or under Trump, Jay Clayton did 25 rules in the first 2 years, \n",
    "was there any comprehensive analysis of the interplay that is \n",
    "now being demanded?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Again, we are following----\n",
    "    Mr. Meuser. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\n",
    "    Mr. Foster. Thank you.\n",
    "    Mr. Meuser. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from \n",
    "South Carolina, Mr. Timmons, is now recognized for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Timmons. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chair Gensler, thank \n",
    "you for being here today.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It is good to see you again.\n",
    "    Mr. Timmons. Yes, sir. The SEC&#x27;s onslaught of rulemaking, I \n",
    "think, is severely impeding U.S. markets in the name of \n",
    "protecting investors from themselves. Your regulatory approach \n",
    "is an insult to the intelligence of Americans and their ability \n",
    "to make risk-based decisions when investing. Quite frankly, we \n",
    "have never seen market participation at the levels we see \n",
    "today. The current ecosystem represents a thriving financial \n",
    "sector where people, no matter their income levels, have access \n",
    "to investment opportunities previously unseen in human history.\n",
    "    And this is why I struggle to rationalize why the SEC \n",
    "continues down this warpath of rushed and quickly-written \n",
    "proposed rules. I could go down the list and probably name \n",
    "dozens of proposals that I think are too broad and lack \n",
    "quantitative analysis or have reduced comment periods, but I am \n",
    "just going to talk about a couple of them.\n",
    "    On December 14, 2022, the SEC released four proposals that \n",
    "would overhaul the regulations governing equity markets. These \n",
    "proposals make sweeping changes to how stock orders are priced, \n",
    "executed, and reported. This is despite the fact that there is \n",
    "no indication of a market failure that would warrant such a \n",
    "sweeping overhaul of the U.S. equity markets. Traditionally, \n",
    "regulatory agencies introduced new regulations in response to \n",
    "market failures or when directed by Congress. Regulators \n",
    "tailored solutions to address the specific problems identified. \n",
    "There is no clear need for change in the market, nor has \n",
    "Congress mandated such sweeping reforms.\n",
    "    The SEC cites the October 2021 SEC staff report on meme \n",
    "stock as a rationale for the proposed rulemaking. However, the \n",
    "report does not recommend any equity market structure reforms. \n",
    "To this point, you have repeated this buzz phrase, ``The \n",
    "playing field isn&#x27;t level,&#x27;&#x27; but you haven&#x27;t explained what \n",
    "that means or cited how it harms investors. Investors have the \n",
    "best user experience and the lowest cost in history. The \n",
    "industry says you are just picking favorites between exchanges \n",
    "versus wholesalers and that retail investors may not actually \n",
    "benefit from these proposals.\n",
    "    That was my long intro. How concerned should we be about \n",
    "the potential for increased costs to investors, especially in \n",
    "scenarios where retail brokers may need to reinstate \n",
    "commissions due to changes like the suggested increase in price \n",
    "improvement?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. The proposals were put out to address \n",
    "individual problems, but they really are about driving greater \n",
    "competition and efficiency. Right now, our equity market on any \n",
    "given day depends on the stock. Between 30 and 50 percent is \n",
    "not in the lit markets, it is being traded in what are called \n",
    "the dark markets, and so we are trying to bring more \n",
    "competition in that. One of the rules that actually has a \n",
    "tremendous amount of support in the comment file for many \n",
    "market participants is about lowering the minimum increment. \n",
    "You can trade at a penny down to half a penny, for instance, \n",
    "and things like that, so we are looking at these comments and \n",
    "we are looking through to update our rules.\n",
    "    Mr. Timmons. Currently, tens of thousands of Americans can \n",
    "trade for free and at their fingertips. Do you think that your \n",
    "proposal will result in the reintroduction of commissions?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Zero commission does not mean it is \n",
    "necessarily for free. There are a lot of things that are going \n",
    "on behind the scenes. When you send a market order, that is a \n",
    "very sweet order, because most investors doing 100 shares are \n",
    "not going to invest another 100 shares or another 10,000 shares \n",
    "behind it.\n",
    "    Mr. Timmons. It is going to result in increased fees for \n",
    "the people who currently have no fees, but----\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Actually, what our economic analysis shows is \n",
    "that in each of these rules, it would benefit. We believe that \n",
    "the benefits are significant.\n",
    "    Mr. Timmons. Sorry. So, you are saying that if this rule \n",
    "goes into effect, the people who are currently trading for free \n",
    "will not have to pay commissions? Because I think they will \n",
    "have to, because that is how the market is going to inevitably \n",
    "function. You are not going to be able to continue providing \n",
    "free trades if this rule goes into effect.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Again, there are separate rules, but the one I \n",
    "was talking about is in terms of lowering the minimum \n",
    "increment. There is a lot of support for the other rules as \n",
    "well to say that brokers have to give their clients best \n",
    "execution seems pretty straightforward to many of us.\n",
    "    Mr. Timmons. I just think that if we are going to try to \n",
    "provide inclusion and participation in the markets for all \n",
    "Americans, we need to do this with a scalpel, not a \n",
    "sledgehammer, and I think you have been using a sledgehammer \n",
    "during your time at the SEC. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield \n",
    "back. Thank you.\n",
    "    Mr. Meuser. The gentleman yields back. The gentlewoman from \n",
    "Texas, Ms. Garcia, is now recognized for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Ms. Garcia. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. \n",
    "Gensler, for joining us here today. I always look forward to \n",
    "your visits, and I am thankful that you are here and we are \n",
    "still all here to finish to the end.\n",
    "    I want to bring back the chart that was referenced by Mr. \n",
    "Foster. This comes from an article written by Bloomberg Law \n",
    "entitled, ``Gensler Lags Predecessors in SEC Rulemaking as ESG \n",
    "Plans Linger.&#x27;&#x27; In fact, they stated that you have the slowest \n",
    "pace in decades. We see that under Bush, it was 34; under \n",
    "Obama, 28; and under Trump, 25, but you have only had 22 rules \n",
    "for the same period of time in the first 2 years. We have had a \n",
    "lot of talk from the other side of the aisle about all these \n",
    "rules, there are too many rules too quickly, you are not \n",
    "listening, you are not doing enough investigations, but \n",
    "Bloomberg seems to think you are a slacker. Are you a slacker, \n",
    "Mr. Gensler?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I don&#x27;t know. I will leave that to others to \n",
    "comment on, but we do things thoughtfully. We do it by the \n",
    "book. We take the economic advice that we get, and Bloomberg \n",
    "Law has these numbers, so they speak for themselves. I think \n",
    "Chair Clayton, under President Trump, did 64 final rules by the \n",
    "time he finished his 4 years, so our rule agenda is----\n",
    "    Ms. Garcia. So, you are not even at half of what the Trump \n",
    "Administration did?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. The chart says we have done 22. We are now at \n",
    "24, and he had done 25, I believe. We just do it thoughtfully. \n",
    "We do it under the law, under the economics, and I will leave \n",
    "it to others to comment. But we are doing it on behalf of the \n",
    "American public and for investors and issuers, and making sure \n",
    "that they don&#x27;t work for the markets, that the market should \n",
    "work for them. And all too often in this country, it is turned \n",
    "around that somehow investors and issuers are there so that \n",
    "some market intermediary makes a profit.\n",
    "    Ms. Garcia. So, it is all about transparency.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Sure.\n",
    "    Ms. Garcia. And could you just in a few words explain to \n",
    "the average viewer who may be watching today why transparency \n",
    "is so important in this area, particularly in this area?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Transparency helps foster competition in \n",
    "markets. When you have transparent pricing of products or if \n",
    "you know that performance of an investment adviser is more \n",
    "transparent, it tends to lower the cost in the middle, and that \n",
    "again helps you, the average working or retired American, to \n",
    "invest, but it also helps the people with good ideas if you \n",
    "lower the cost in the middle. And that tends to come from \n",
    "transparency, just like when you are buying an automobile, it \n",
    "is good to know the transparency of what a few different auto \n",
    "dealers are charging for that same automobile.\n",
    "    Ms. Garcia. Okay. The other issue that you and I have \n",
    "discussed many times is how important financial literacy and \n",
    "education is in this sector, and the last time you were here, I \n",
    "told you of my concern about financial literacy, not only in my \n",
    "district, but in all of Texas. The Federal Reserve Bank of \n",
    "Dallas reports that 8 percent of Texans do not have a bank \n",
    "account and 37 percent of Texans have not planned for \n",
    "retirement. Financial literacy, of course, is key. Chair \n",
    "Gensler, could you provide an update on the SEC&#x27;s educational \n",
    "efforts to improve financial literacy not only in Texas, but \n",
    "across the nation, to improve people&#x27;s understanding of the \n",
    "work that your agency does?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We have an Office of Investor Education and \n",
    "Advocacy. It is a very important office. We also put out \n",
    "investor alerts often on our website, and we try to engage with \n",
    "the public, the broad investing public, to help them understand \n",
    "the markets, but also to protect themselves against wrongdoers \n",
    "in the markets, and if you have something to tell us, to also \n",
    "tell us through the tips, complaints, and referral.\n",
    "    Ms. Garcia. Right. I also have a follow-up question on the \n",
    "financial inclusion regarding literacy--not literacy, but the \n",
    "language barriers. What are we doing to address any language \n",
    "barriers on behalf of members of our communities and our \n",
    "constituents in terms of investors?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. That&#x27;s a very important issue. We have \n",
    "certainly done some things recently with regard to shareholder \n",
    "reports, but I think I would want to get back to you, because \n",
    "it is an important issue about language.\n",
    "    Ms. Garcia. Thank you.\n",
    "    And, Mr. Chairman, I also would like to offer for the \n",
    "record the articles that I referenced earlier.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. That is available to Members generally, \n",
    "and without objection, it is so ordered.\n",
    "    Ms. Garcia. Thank you.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. We will now recognize the gentleman from \n",
    "Pennsylvania, Mr. Meuser, for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Meuser. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Gensler, it&#x27;s \n",
    "good to see you.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It&#x27;s good to see you, Mr. Meuser.\n",
    "    Mr. Meuser. Thank you. The SEC&#x27;s climate rule&#x27;s Scope 3 \n",
    "provision mandates reporting on emissions from activities not \n",
    "directly controlled by a company up and down its supply chain, \n",
    "as you all know, so supply chains, let&#x27;s say, from China or \n",
    "some other offshore source, for example, which are perhaps less \n",
    "scrutinized and submit data which could be suspect as opposed \n",
    "to from a U.S. resource, is an example of how Scope 3 data \n",
    "could be flawed and the system as a whole. What are your \n",
    "thoughts on that, and is this capital towards certain \n",
    "industries as opposed to something else? What is the intent?\n",
    "    And the other thing I would like to ask is, now it is \n",
    "rattling many companies, right? This rule won&#x27;t go into effect \n",
    "perhaps until next year. Companies are preparing for it. \n",
    "Private companies are preparing for it, and there are is a lot \n",
    "of additional compliance that goes along with it. Could you \n",
    "comment on that?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Those are two very good questions. First one, \n",
    "many investors are looking at what is the risk of companies \n",
    "with potential climate change, and one of the measures of that \n",
    "risk is the greenhouse gas emissions of the company and \n",
    "possibly their supply chain or so-called value chain. Although \n",
    "many companies know their own greenhouse gas emissions, they \n",
    "don&#x27;t necessarily know, as you rightly pointed out, their \n",
    "entire supply chain, and fewer public companies are currently \n",
    "publishing that. We put out a proposal to bring consistency to \n",
    "the disclosure, but we heard a lot of comments coming in to say \n",
    "Scope 3 disclosure is not as well-developed. It is not as many \n",
    "companies are putting out. It is, frankly, not yet as reliable, \n",
    "and so we are taking that into consideration.\n",
    "    And I would say another thing is some people have raised \n",
    "from the farm belt, for instance, agriculture interest. We \n",
    "don&#x27;t want to have to do this, we don&#x27;t need to do this. And \n",
    "we, the SEC, don&#x27;t regulate those private companies, those non-\n",
    "public companies, and so staff is looking very closely to \n",
    "ensure that we stay within our authorities, and it is about the \n",
    "public companies.\n",
    "    On your second question about cost, we take that very \n",
    "thoughtfully into consideration, and we got a lot of comments. \n",
    "I was chatting with the Member across the aisle about this, and \n",
    "we need to take that into consideration.\n",
    "    Mr. Meuser. Can you give us the analysis of some of those \n",
    "costs? That was a follow-up question. Can you give us the \n",
    "analysis on the costs that you are taking into consideration? \n",
    "Have you run the numbers and----\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We are, in essence, adjusting our economic \n",
    "analysis because we got so much feedback from the public on \n",
    "that particularly important point.\n",
    "    Mr. Meuser. On the safeguarding rule as well, you mentioned \n",
    "you were on and off. Director Birdthistle mentioned that he \n",
    "talks extensively with banking regulators. There are many \n",
    "regulators, however, in that field--and this is regarding the \n",
    "safeguarding rule--that if you talk more often with them, this \n",
    "rule would be written differently. What is your reaction to \n",
    "that?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We have good, ongoing discussions with our \n",
    "colleagues at the bank regulators. We continue to engage on \n",
    "this rule and on other rules and, of course, on market \n",
    "oversight. And the safeguarding rule is one where we have heard \n",
    "a lot from not only the investment advisers that it applies to, \n",
    "but from the banks that act as qualified custodians.\n",
    "    Mr. Meuser. Okay. Thanks. I am changing gears a little bit \n",
    "here. There was a recent shareholder vote to extend the \n",
    "deadline for the DWAC and TMTG merger, which demonstrated that \n",
    "nearly 400,000 investors want this merger to happen. Can you \n",
    "give me your assurance or feedback that a revised S-4 handled \n",
    "in regular order will be expedited, whether for this merger or \n",
    "any others?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Again, as you are aware, that is a company \n",
    "that recently settled an enforcement action because it \n",
    "initially had a material misrepresentation of when it went \n",
    "public in its S-1. I don&#x27;t think they have filed an S-4 with us \n",
    "yet, but when they do, our Division of Corporation Finance \n",
    "would handle it in regular order.\n",
    "    Mr. Meuser. I appreciate that very much. I yield back, Mr. \n",
    "Chairman.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. \n",
    "Nickel, is recognized for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Nickel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Gensler, \n",
    "thanks for being here. I want to start by applauding the \n",
    "important work of the SEC and the public servants who work \n",
    "under you. You have a lot to be proud of. But a lot of the \n",
    "decisions you have made, frankly, have me scratching my head to \n",
    "try to understand your thought process and what goes into the \n",
    "decisions that you make. And I tried to figure out, how can I \n",
    "understand Chairman Gensler a little bit more, and I read and \n",
    "saw that you are a marathoner and an ultra-marathoner? Is that \n",
    "right?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. In my day, yes, I did the John F. Kennedy 50-\n",
    "miler.\n",
    "    Mr. Nickel. I looked and found that less than a quarter, 1 \n",
    "percent of the world&#x27;s population, has done a marathon. I did \n",
    "the New York Marathon, so I have at least accomplished one. And \n",
    "being here now for over 3 hours testifying before Congress in a \n",
    "hearing like this probably isn&#x27;t one of the things on your \n",
    "schedule that you are super excited about. But how would you \n",
    "rate testifying in Congress versus a marathon? Which is easier?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I love being in front of this committee. I \n",
    "have been here probably 20 times in my life. It is a great room \n",
    "and a great committee. Marathons are a little harder.\n",
    "    Mr. Nickel. Thanks. Okay. I want to get into \n",
    "securitization.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. If the gentleman suspends----\n",
    "    Mr. Nickel. I yield for the question.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. We ask the witness to answer the \n",
    "question.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I think that this is easier than running the \n",
    "New York City Marathon.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. Okay.\n",
    "    Mr. Nickel. Thank you. So, securitization is a cornerstone \n",
    "of affordable access to credit for families and businesses in \n",
    "my district. I represent North Carolina&#x27;s 13th district. For \n",
    "example, securitization funds around 70 percent of residential \n",
    "mortgage loans every year and provides funding for auto loans \n",
    "and credit cards. I am concerned that your rule proposal on \n",
    "conflicts of interest will impair the ability of securitization \n",
    "markets to function by outlawing activities that have no \n",
    "connection with securitization transactions and reducing \n",
    "participation in those markets. This would increase the cost \n",
    "and reduce the availability of consumer mortgage and business \n",
    "credit for my constituents, which is a real problem. And, \n",
    "frankly, we have an economy that doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, and \n",
    "it is so hard for so many of the constituents I represent to \n",
    "get credit and to get a loan and to do those things.\n",
    "    The SEC said it was, ``unable to reliably quantify many of \n",
    "the economic effects,&#x27;&#x27; of the proposed rule, given these \n",
    "uncertainties and to avoid compounding the credit crunch that \n",
    "is already, again, hitting my constituents incredibly hard. \n",
    "Will you commit to re-proposing a rule that is more tailored to \n",
    "the feedback that SEC has received from the public?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. One, the capital markets are really important \n",
    "for credit cards, auto loans, and mortgages through this \n",
    "securitization market. Two, Congress mandated that we actually \n",
    "do a rule to address potential conflicts that sponsors of those \n",
    "asset securitizations might have if they are on the other side, \n",
    "taking positions in conflict with the investors. That is what \n",
    "we are doing. We have a robust, good comment file on that. We \n",
    "are looking at that closely. I can&#x27;t prejudge it, but I think \n",
    "that the comments that we received, we can hopefully sort \n",
    "through.\n",
    "    Mr. Nickel. Thanks, and I certainly urge you to re-propose \n",
    "the rule as it threatens to disrupt the housing market in North \n",
    "Carolina and across the country. I want to move on to our \n",
    "Grayscale letter. I sent a letter to you yesterday along with \n",
    "my colleagues, Congressmen Flood, Torres, and Emmer, urging you \n",
    "to approve the listing of spot Bitcoin ETPs after your recent \n",
    "loss in court to Grayscale. Now that the SEC has the court&#x27;s \n",
    "decision in hand rejecting your rationale for denial, does the \n",
    "SEC plan to approve the current pending spot Bitcoin ETF \n",
    "applications?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Thank you for your letter. I did read it last \n",
    "night. Again, we are still taking this under advisement. It is \n",
    "a recent court action, and staff and Commissioners will take it \n",
    "up as appropriate.\n",
    "    Mr. Nickel. The court concluded the SEC&#x27;s denial of \n",
    "Grayscale lacked, ``a coherent explanation,&#x27;&#x27; and then, ``falls \n",
    "short of the standard for reasoned decision making,&#x27;&#x27; and was, \n",
    "``arbitrary and capricious.&#x27;&#x27; How do you explain the SEC&#x27;s \n",
    "actions there?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We do that which we do under the law as best \n",
    "we can. Sometimes, things go to court. We are still considering \n",
    "that court decision. I think it was a district court--I&#x27;m \n",
    "sorry--it was an appellate court, but we are still considering \n",
    "that appellate court decision, and I don&#x27;t want to get ahead of \n",
    "the staff or my fellow Commissioners.\n",
    "    Mr. Nickel. Thanks so much, and I will note that 3 hours is \n",
    "far below my marathon time. Not even close, but I yield back.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman yields back. I will now \n",
    "recognize the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Fitzgerald.\n",
    "    Mr. Fitzgerald. Chairman Gensler, thanks for being here. \n",
    "Congressmen Lucas and Posey talked about this earlier, but I am \n",
    "going to bring it up again. It deals with the proposals \n",
    "regarding predictive data analytics. Could you distill it down \n",
    "again? Is there a lack of economic analysis, and is that \n",
    "consistent kind of with the SEC&#x27;s mission to protect investors? \n",
    "How do you see those two kind of meshing?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Those are good questions. One, there is a \n",
    "robust economic analysis, but we are going to benefit from \n",
    "public feedback on it. But two, the rationale, and the \n",
    "rationale comes to a really key thing, investment adviser, \n",
    "whether it is through a robo-adviser or a broker-dealer, that \n",
    "they continue to put the investing public&#x27;s interests first \n",
    "when they are engaging with us, what is called investor \n",
    "interaction, and they are not putting their interest in front \n",
    "of ours. So they can use data analytics and use math to put \n",
    "their interest ahead of ours, and that is not good for the \n",
    "investing public.\n",
    "    Mr. Nickel. Are you afraid it will be applied to directly \n",
    "on just about everything? It could go down to the level of \n",
    "Excel spreadsheets. It somehow it has to be applied, right?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Here is the sort of balancing act. We are \n",
    "technology-neutral, so whether you use, as you say, an Excel \n",
    "spreadsheet or you use machine learning, sort of the core \n",
    "question is, are you engaging with the investors and pushing \n",
    "them for your profits, not your personal profits, but the \n",
    "investment adviser&#x27;s profits or the investor&#x27;s? But we have a \n",
    "lot of comments. The comment file is open until, I think, \n",
    "October 10th, so we are still hearing from the public, and this \n",
    "hearing today is a very important part of that.\n",
    "    Mr. Nickel. A couple of times, you have said that in the \n",
    "SEC&#x27;s rulemakings, you are just kind of simply doing what \n",
    "Congress has asked for. Do you think that is consistent? There \n",
    "are 40-some rule proposals, and I don&#x27;t know that Congress sked \n",
    "for all of those, so how are you measuring that right now?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. You raise a good point. It is not that you \n",
    "asked for it last week or last month, but our laws embodied by \n",
    "Congress are on the books. And we need, I think, really, to \n",
    "stay competitive in the world, to update our roadblocks to make \n",
    "sure that the markets, the Wall Street broker-dealers, the \n",
    "exchanges, and the investment advisers are working on behalf of \n",
    "your constituents, the investors, and the people with good \n",
    "ideas who want to raise money. And it is trying to drive \n",
    "greater efficiency in the middle of that market, and sometimes \n",
    "the middle of the market doesn&#x27;t love that because greater \n",
    "efficiency might mean a little less economic rents, a little \n",
    "less profit in the middle.\n",
    "    Mr. Nickel. Let me switch gears again. I think we are \n",
    "concerned about the Financial Stability Oversight Council&#x27;s \n",
    "(FSOC&#x27;s) recent proposal regarding the designation of the non-\n",
    "bank financial institutions as systemically important, \n",
    "particularly the elimination of a cost-benefit analysis \n",
    "requirement. Given your position as a FSOC member, why would \n",
    "the FSOC eliminate the requirement to do a cost-benefit \n",
    "analysis when determining whether or not a nonbank financial \n",
    "institution should be designated as systemically important?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Thank you. I am a member of the Financial \n",

    "    Mr. Gensler. Congress gave us the challenge to do that, and \n",
    "that is why we put it out to public comment, but you are \n",

    "fun this week. I just want to thank you for your time today and \n",
    "your expertise.\n",
    "    I know you have discussed this at length today, and it has \n",
    "been a big focus in all of the areas of the key functions that \n",
    "our agencies play in helping support and advocate for our \n",
    "constituents. And Ranking Member Waters touched on the real \n",
    "harm that a government shutdown would do, specifically to your \n",
    "agency, and should there be a government shutdown, only around \n",
    "400 employees will be retained to maintain minimal functions, \n",
    "with nearly 4,200 employees being furloughed.\n",
    "    The barebones staff that will remain working during a \n",
    "shutdown cannot perform all the responsibilities adequately. \n",
    "And you have spent time discussing a number of the functions \n",
    "that the SEC will not be able to manage, like protecting \n",
    "Americans from fraud, allowing investors to access our capital \n",
    "markets, and conducting investor outreach and education, among \n",
    "other important roles of your agency. And it is deeply \n",
    "concerning for me with the long-term implications of the chaos \n",
    "and dysfunction here in Washington, and the perception globally \n",
    "around what role the United States is going to play, and if we \n",
    "are a market that people should continue to invest in, and the \n",
    "real concerns out there. In your opinion, how do you think that \n",
    "a government shutdown would impact America&#x27;s capital markets \n",
    "and the global gold standard that we have always had?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. In the short term, there is a risk that we, \n",
    "the government&#x27;s important market regulator, wouldn&#x27;t have the \n",
    "resources to oversee the markets, whether it is a day, a month, \n",
    "or whatever it is. In the longer term, it is just the \n",
    "confidence in our capital markets and our confidence in our \n",
    "system of deciding the fiscal choices that Congress and the \n",
    "Administration does, and we see those challenges in terms of \n",
    "investors around the globe. We are 40 percent of the world&#x27;s \n",
    "capital markets, but we are only 23 percent of the world&#x27;s \n",

    "class, so to speak. That is a good thing, but the confidence in \n",
    "our system can be shaken as well.\n",
    "    Ms. Pettersen. And we saw that recently, with not actually \n",
    "coming to an agreement and potentially going off a fiscal \n",
    "cliff. Even though that didn&#x27;t happen, we know that we were \n",
    "downgraded with one bureau. There are going to be long-term \n",
    "economic consequences. But we know that there are billions of \n",
    "dollars of damage because for the first time, people are \n",
    "questioning whether or not the United States will pay their \n",
    "bills, and so these political games have long-term risks. This \n",
    "is an area that I know you have a background in, and it is \n",
    "going to be absolutely essential that we are working in \n",
    "partnership to address the opportunities and challenges that \n",
    "artificial intelligence (AI) poses for this country, and \n",
    "specifically for our financial system.\n",
    "    On the morning of May 22nd of this year, an AI-generated \n",
    "image of an explosion near the Pentagon spread widely \n",
    "throughout social media. Immediately, the stock market dipped, \n",
    "and we saw a significant decline. We were able to recover when \n",
    "we were able to confirm that it was, in fact, fake, but we know \n",
    "that these are challenges that we are going to have to address \n",
    "together.\n",

    "    Ms. Pettersen. AI has the potential to significantly impact \n",
    "our financial system and our capital markets and our banking \n",
    "system, and this needs to be addressed at every level on how we \n",

    "the future?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It is probably going to drive productivity and \n",
    "so forth, but in the financial sector, I do think that there is \n",
    "a risk of deep fakes. Look, fraud is fraud. Even if you are \n",
    "using artificial intelligence, there is usually some human \n",
    "behind it, but that is a real challenge to focus on.\n",
    "    Ms. Pettersen. Okay. I yield back. Thank you.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentlelady yields back. The \n",
    "gentlelady from California, Mrs. Kim, is now recognized for 5 \n",
    "minutes.\n",
    "    Mrs. Kim. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Chairman Gensler, \n",
    "thanks for being with us today. I am concerned that the SEC, \n",
    "under your leadership, has not carefully considered the \n",
    "aggregate costs of an overlapping nature of your proposed rules \n",
    "and regulations, and, as you heard, there is an erratic pace of \n",
    "your proposals. I want to paraphrase your own words, the \n",
    "erratic pace of your proposals undermines the finest capital \n",
    "markets in the world, and each proposed rulemaking, now over 50 \n",
    "since the spring of 2021, will make it more costly for small \n",
    "businesses to raise capital in the markets and more difficult \n",
    "for hardworking investors in my district to benefit from gains \n",
    "in the markets and to save for retirement.\n",
    "    And I remember when you came before our committee early \n",
    "this year, you said that the SEC&#x27;s hardcore proposal would \n",
    "level the playing field for my constituents, but I completely \n",
    "disagree with that notion, and I urge you to please revisit the \n",
    "swing pricing and hard close proposals. I know some of my \n",
    "colleagues across the aisle also raised this issue.\n",
    "    So please tell me, how would the hard close proposal level \n",
    "the playing field for my constituents in Southern California \n",
    "when you are proposing a hard close at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, \n",
    "which s 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time? Could you answer that?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Again, what we are trying to address is to \n",
    "ensure that when somebody redeems from a mutual fund, they \n",
    "don&#x27;t leave everybody else in that mutual fund with losses or \n",
    "what is called dilution. I would say, given the clock, right \n",
    "now, anybody in your district already has to put the redemption \n",
    "order in at 1:00 p.m., and we are not changing that.\n",
    "    Mrs. Kim. Let me reclaim, and I want to tell you that I am \n",
    "specifically talking about my constituents being put at a \n",
    "competitive disadvantage compared to someone operating in \n",
    "Eastern Time. So, you don&#x27;t believe that a fund or an investor \n",
    "in California would be put at a disadvantage when they have to \n",
    "stop trading at 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time, whether it is mutual \n",
    "funds or whatever you are talking about?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I am just observing currently, because the New \n",
    "York Stock Exchange is closed by 4:00 East Coast Time, and \n",
    "mutual funds redemptions are by 4:00 p.m., and we are not \n",
    "changing that. That already exists.\n",
    "    Mrs. Kim. Again, 4:00 Eastern Time is 1:00 p.m. Pacific \n",
    "Time, so in my home State of California, obviously, we are very \n",
    "concerned about this because we have to stop trading at 1:00 \n",
    "p.m., but let me move on.\n",
    "    I know in my home State of California, Silicon Valley Bank \n",
    "(SVB) failed largely because it wasn&#x27;t hedging its interest \n",
    "rate risk, and you have proposed a rule on conflicts of \n",
    "interest for securitization that will make hedging this exact \n",
    "type of risk much more difficult. Surely, this is not the \n",
    "intent of the statute or your proposal, but it is what the rule \n",
    "as written would do. And I heard your response, your engagement \n",
    "with Congressman Fitzgerald, that hedging is mandated, but that \n",
    "is not what I am hearing. So, I would like to ask you if you \n",
    "can commit to working with me to ensure that the final rule \n",
    "clarifies that risk mitigating hedging is allowed because the \n",
    "current rule is unclear on that point.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Again, I think it was Congress that has that \n",
    "risk mitigation hedging but not trading against the investors, \n",
    "and so we put it out to public comment. But you have raised an \n",
    "issue of just broad general interest rate hedging.\n",
    "    Mrs. Kim. I am talking about that hedging issue, which is \n",
    "very important, and with all due respect, I believe the lawyers \n",
    "outside every office disagree, and I think the last thing we \n",
    "want is a chilling effect on hedging. And let me remind you, \n",
    "SVB is a glaring example of how to get things wrong, and I hope \n",
    "we can work together to ensure that the final rule leaves the \n",
    "important risk mitigation tools intact.\n",
    "    I want to talk about the 34 items on your proposed rules \n",
    "list for 2022, which is triple that of the previous year and, \n",
    "in fact, over the past 2 decades, 2021 was the only time the \n",
    "Commission proposed more rules, which obviously was mandated by \n",
    "the Dodd-Frank Act. The October Inspector General report said \n",
    "that the staff believe that your more aggressive agenda \n",
    "potentially limits the time available for staff resources and \n",
    "analysis and increases the litigation risk, so can I just throw \n",
    "in the question of, what sort of things increase litigation \n",
    "risk? Would you be able to respond to that?\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman can answer in written form \n",
    "for the record.\n",
    "    Mrs. Kim. Okay. Thank you.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. Ms. Pressley of Massachusetts is now \n",
    "recognized for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Ms. Pressley. Thank you, Chair Gensler, for joining us \n",
    "today. There are unrelenting people, institutions, forces at \n",
    "work that seek to dismantle gains that have been made in \n",
    "diversity and equity and inclusion from corner offices, State \n",
    "legislatures, the Supreme Court, and my colleagues across the \n",
    "aisle. In fact, when they got the gavel, the very first thing \n",
    "that they did, one of their very first actions was to dissolve \n",
    "the Diversity and Inclusion Subcommittee of this Financial \n",
    "Services Committee, that was stood up by Ranking Member Waters, \n",
    "the Committee Chair at the time, and that subcommittee was \n",
    "headed by Joyce Beatty. The other side isn&#x27;t taking any days \n",
    "off, so I am not taking any days off either. And that is why I \n",
    "want to talk to you about diversity on corporate boards and \n",
    "understanding the importance of disclosure and transparency \n",
    "when it comes to gender, racial diversity, and other data, \n",
    "along with the ways in which that can impact financial \n",
    "performance.\n",
    "    We all know that corporate boards are powerful. They play a \n",
    "critical role in determining the mission of a company, its \n",
    "values, its vision, its strategy, everything from who the \n",
    "company will hire to which stakeholders it listens to. Now, for \n",
    "decades, White men have made up the majority of corporate board \n",
    "members, and they still do. Across the S&amp;P 500 companies, \n",
    "nearly a third of boards of directors are women, despite women \n",
    "making up 50 percent of the country. Only 22 percent are people \n",
    "of color, despite people of color making up 41 percent of the \n",
    "country. These gender and racial disparities should not be \n",
    "ignored. The Securities and Exchange Commission plays a \n",
    "critical role in overseeing corporate governance, and that \n",
    "includes work related to diversity and transparency.\n",
    "    Chair Gensler, research shows that diverse boards better \n",
    "reflect our country, and--I want to underscore this--lead to \n",
    "improved financial results for companies. I could sit here and \n",
    "debate fairness and morality and the right side of history all \n",
    "day, but as my good friends, and Black women on boards so often \n",
    "say, this is not a matter of Black or White; it is a matter of \n",
    "green, so this is about improved outcomes. What is the SEC \n",
    "doing to increase disclosures on corporate board diversity and \n",
    "inclusion?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Early in my time at the SEC, we had in front \n",
    "of us a filing from the stock exchange called Nasdaq. It is a \n",
    "self-regulatory organization that actually has a listing \n",
    "requirement. Nasdaq addressed these issues. Under the Exchange \n",
    "Act, under the laws we approve, that is still a matter of court \n",
    "challenge in the Fifth Circuit, if I recall, and I know that is \n",
    "out there, but I think that----\n",
    "    Ms. Pressley. Let me reclaim my time, because I am running \n",
    "out of it here. That is right. The Nasdaq proposal that was \n",
    "approved by the SEC calls for two diverse board members based \n",
    "on gender, race, and LGBTQ status. So, this information is \n",
    "important, do you agree? Yes or no?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We approved it under the Exchange Act, under \n",
    "the guidance there. I have to be very careful about that.\n",
    "    Ms. Pressley. Okay. At the end of the day, disclosure of \n",
    "this data is necessary because we know that that which gets \n",
    "measured, gets done, so we need that transparency. And I also \n",
    "think that the SEC needs to go much further and require greater \n",
    "disclosure of diversity, such as disability status, and greater \n",
    "disclosure of the company, including senior management and the \n",
    "workforce. So, will the SEC commit to looking into expanding \n",
    "diversity and inclusion disclosures?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Staff has continued to work not only on this, \n",
    "but, more broadly, also in human capital disclosures.\n",
    "    Ms. Pressley. Yes or no, Chairman Gensler, my time is \n",
    "running out, so can you make that commitment? This shouldn&#x27;t be \n",
    "a hard commitment. Can you make that commitment to look to \n",
    "expand diversity and inclusion disclosures beyond just the \n",
    "Nasdaq proposal?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. The staff of our Division of Corporation \n",
    "Finance continues to review alternatives there.\n",
    "    Ms. Pressley. Okay. Thank you. Just a quick history lesson. \n",
    "The first Black woman on a corporate board was Patricia Roberts \n",
    "Harris, and she was only appointed in 1971, roughly 50 years \n",
    "ago. The year is 2023, and it is well past time that we have \n",
    "corporate boards that reflect the true diversity of our \n",
    "country, not only from a place of justice and fairness, but for \n",
    "improved financial outcomes. My colleagues across the aisle \n",
    "have already made it clear they don&#x27;t care about diversity. \n",
    "Their first action when they took back the gavel of this \n",
    "committee was to scrap the Diversity and Inclusion Subcommittee \n",
    "established by Ranking Member Waters. They are on the wrong \n",
    "side of history when it comes to this issue, as are so many \n",
    "others. Chairman Gensler, it is important that the SEC be on \n",
    "the right side of history and press forward with the corporate \n",
    "board diversity.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Flood, \n",
    "is recognized for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Flood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chair Gensler, I would \n",
    "like to continue our discussion about the SEC&#x27;s Staff \n",
    "Accounting Bulletin No. 121 (SAB 121) that would potentially \n",
    "have significant effects on the ability of banks to custody \n",
    "digital assets. Let&#x27;s briefly begin by following up on \n",
    "something that was raised the last time you were in front of \n",
    "this committee. You previously said that prior to the issuance \n",
    "of SAB 121, your staff did not confer with any of the \n",
    "prudential regulators. Is that correct?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. You would have the transcript, but I think \n",
    "that our staffs do talk to the prudential regulators.\n",
    "    Mr. Flood. Prior to the issuance of SAB 121, did your staff \n",
    "confer with any of the prudential regulators?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. With regard to that particular staff bulletin, \n",
    "I don&#x27;t recall that they did. I know that they have----\n",
    "    Mr. Flood. Let&#x27;s let the record reflect that the SEC staff \n",
    "did not think to confer with the prudential regulators before \n",
    "issuing the staff accounting bulletin. In response to my \n",
    "question for the record from April on this topic, you stated, \n",
    "``SAB 121 provides nonbinding staff guidance on the application \n",
    "of existing accounting and disclosure requirements under U.S. \n",
    "GAAP.&#x27;&#x27; Prior to the issuance of SAB 121, did the Financial \n",
    "Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issue anything related to the \n",
    "custody of digital assets, and if so, what was issued?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I would have to get back to you, but if you \n",
    "are asking about the Financial Accounting Standards Board, I \n",
    "don&#x27;t know that they have done something on custody, but we \n",
    "could get back to you.\n",
    "    Mr. Flood. Since you cited the generally accepted \n",
    "accounting principles (GAAP) in your response, I decided I \n",
    "would take a look at this myself. Prior to SAB 121&#x27;s issuance, \n",
    "FASB had not published anything related to the custody of \n",
    "digital assets. In fact, the Board added accounting standards \n",
    "for digital assets to its agenda in May of 2022, 2 months after \n",
    "the issuance of SAB 121. Your response to my question for the \n",
    "record from April also indicated that SAB 121 provides guidance \n",
    "on the application of existing accounting and disclosure \n",
    "requirements under the SEC rules, so here is a question: Prior \n",
    "to the issuance of SAB 121, what rules had the SEC finalized \n",
    "relating to the safeguarding of digital assets?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We have on the books a rule from 2009 that \n",
    "applies to the custody of digital assets by investment advisers \n",
    "because it covers all funds and securities. That rule is on the \n",
    "books. We also had finalized something around special purpose \n",
    "broker-dealers, which relates to crypto broker-dealers.\n",
    "    Mr. Flood. I took a look at this topic myself. The answer, \n",
    "quite frankly, is none. There were no SEC rules on the books \n",
    "that directly addressed the topic of custody of digital assets. \n",
    "As you well know, the SEC issued a proposed rulemaking on \n",
    "custody, including digital asset custody, in February of 2023, \n",
    "and that rule has not been finalized to this day. So to recap, \n",
    "the SEC failed to confer with prudential regulators, despite \n",
    "the fact that anything changing the rules around the custody of \n",
    "assets for banks, regardless of whether the bank is publicly \n",
    "traded, would be of obvious consequence to them.\n",
    "    Then, when justifying the bulletin, the SEC cited the GAAP \n",
    "and SEC rulings. However, at the time the bulletin was issued, \n",
    "there was no action by FASB, and no rulemaking from the SEC on \n",
    "this topic. In April, you said you wanted the SEC to, ``stay in \n",
    "our lane,&#x27;&#x27; with regard to SAB 121&#x27;s potential effects on a \n",
    "bank&#x27;s balance sheet. It is fair to say that the fact pattern \n",
    "we have is that the SEC is not just going out of its lane, but \n",
    "it failed to comprehend the existence of any conflict with \n",
    "prudential rules.\n",
    "    Additionally, the SEC&#x27;s justification for issuing the \n",
    "bulletin is based on accounting guidelines that did not exist \n",
    "when the bulletin was issued, and rulemaking that was not even \n",
    "started until nearly a year after the bulletin was issued. It \n",
    "is pretty obvious that one of two things happened, and both are \n",
    "bad. On one hand, it is possible that the SEC was well aware \n",
    "that there was no strong justification for issuing the bulletin \n",
    "and chose to do it anyway. That would show a pretty \n",
    "straightforward case of regulating by guidance and \n",
    "unsubstantiated theory.\n",
    "    On the other hand, the SEC made some obvious basic mistakes \n",
    "in the issuance of this bulletin. In light of these mistakes, \n",
    "it is worth mentioning the SEC Inspector General&#x27;s report on \n",
    "management and performance challenges. Among other things, the \n",
    "report indicated that very high attrition has required the SEC \n",
    "to rely on detailees with little or no experience to contribute \n",
    "to the core regulatory tasks such as rulemaking. The case of \n",
    "SAB 121 raises the question of whether the SEC is compromised. \n",
    "Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman yields back. I will now \n",
    "recognize the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Lynch, for 5 \n",
    "minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Lynch. Welcome, Chairman Gensler. I don&#x27;t know if you \n",
    "need time to respond to that?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I would just say, Mr. Flood, if I can, because \n",
    "the other Member allowed me to, that the SAB 121 guidance is \n",
    "based on GAAP. GAAP already exists. It doesn&#x27;t need a new FASB \n",

    "willingness to enforce the law where it applies. I appreciate \n",
    "that, especially in the crypto space.\n",
    "    After many, many decisions in favor of the SEC&#x27;s position, \n",
    "the SEC saw its first split decision, I would say, in a major \n",
    "crypto case in court with the July 13th ruling involving \n",
    "Ripple&#x27;s XRP. In a partial victory, I guess, for Ripple, the \n",
    "Southern District of New York held that XRP was not a security \n",
    "when sold on a public exchange, but it is when sold to \n",

    "counterintuitive, given the vulnerability of individual \n",

    "that invites into the legal analysis involving crypto.\n",
    "    But the wider picture is that I worry that we are heading \n",
    "towards a pattern of court battles to determine if each \n",
    "individual token is either a security or not, and I just wanted \n",
    "to know what your thoughts were on that decision. I know it is \n",
    "far from over. This case is far from over, but I just want you \n",
    "to express to the committee what your views are on that issue \n",
    "and on that decision, to the degree you can do so.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I appreciate the opportunity, Congressman, but \n",
    "as we, as a Commission, actually have filings in front of that \n",
    "court on this matter right now, I think those filings speak for \n",

    "    Mr. Lynch. Okay.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. In essence, we filed to potentially do an \n",
    "interlocutory appeal.\n",
    "    Mr. Lynch. Okay. Fair enough. I suspected as much. One of \n",
    "the major proposals in the recent digital assets market \n",
    "structure legislation involves allowing a crypto firm to \n",
    "provisionally register and to be held harmless for a post-\n",
    "registration period. By now, we are all well aware of the \n",
    "damage caused by FTX when its CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, defrauded \n",
    "millions of customers. More recently, the SEC took action \n",
    "against Binance for potentially, I think, similar behavior from \n",
    "lots of things.\n",
    "    The Binance complaint contains damaging allegations, \n",
    "including operating an unregistered securities exchange, broker \n",
    "and clearing agency. Further, Mr. Zhao of Binance&#x27;s operation, \n",
    "control of customer assets, permitted them to commingle again, \n",
    "just like FTX customer assets, and divert customer assets as \n",
    "they pleased. There are some concerns about this bill that we \n",
    "did, the digital asset microstructure bill, that it opens up a \n",
    "vulnerability for consumers to be harmed. And I was wondering \n",
    "if you had a view on that, and is there any concern that we \n",
    "should have with the way the bill is currently structured?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. If I can speak about the field itself, rather \n",
    "than speaking about the bill, it is a common practice in the \n",
    "crypto field right now to comingle that which we don&#x27;t allow to \n",
    "be commingled elsewhere, and with commingling, what you might \n",
    "think of is an exchange like the New York Stock Exchange. With \n",
    "brokers, you can think of your own individual brokers, and \n",
    "maybe a hedge fund, or even a high frequency trading shop, and \n",
    "even a clearinghouse, and maybe even some bank-like functions, \n",
    "and it is a recipe that has not led to good results in the \n",
    "crypto field and a lot of investors being harmed. So if \n",
    "Congress did anything, it would be separating out those \n",
    "conflicts.\n",
    "    Mr. Lynch. Thank you.\n",

    "    Mr. Norman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Gensler, are you \n",
    "aware of Prometheum company?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. A company? I have heard of that company, yes, \n",
    "sir.\n",
    "    Mr. Norman. They testified before us back on June 13th. The \n",
    "CEO and founder of Prometheum testified before us, and he \n",
    "assured us that only 20 percent of the company is owned by \n",
    "China. Does that concern you at all? And I assume you know they \n",
    "are a broker-dealer, a special purpose broker-dealer for \n",
    "digital asset securities.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Any registrant in our markets has to comply \n",
    "with our laws, and whether they are partially owned or wholly \n",
    "owned by China----\n",
    "    Mr. Norman. But I am saying, in your position, does that \n",
    "concern you, 20 percent owned by China and the information that \n",
    "could be easily transferred to China, which is an enemy of this \n",
    "country?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Sorry. What is really important, regardless of \n",
    "whether it is China or any other country, is that it is a \n",
    "privilege to be in our capital markets, and that those \n",
    "companies comply with our laws, whether it is the company you \n",
    "mentioned or any other company, controlled or partially owned \n",

    "    Mr. Norman. They may comply with the laws, but still the \n",

    "    Mr. Norman. Of 2023, yes. Yes, that is right. We sent it 10 \n",
    "weeks earlier. It took 10 weeks, which is my point, to get this \n",
    "back. And what we asked you to do is look into that, into the \n",
    "China connection, which is of serious concern, should be of \n",
    "yours in your role. Basically, and I am not going to read it, \n",
    "this is just a nonresponse. It is just words, and what is \n",
    "concerning to me is if somebody in your role is just shuffling \n",
    "paper, it is a danger to this country.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. There are a number of broker-dealers in our \n",

    "is not the only one. I think your letter and some other letters \n",
    "from the Senator name some of the others, and those broker-\n",
    "dealers have to comply with our laws. They actually have to, \n",
    "under our laws, have their books and records here so they can \n",
    "be inspected and looked at by FINRA, which you mentioned.\n",
    "    Mr. Norman. Does China go by the rules? Does Communist \n",
    "China go by the rules?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. They have a different set of laws there. They \n",
    "have a different government. But I am saying, if you are here \n",
    "in the U.S., they have to comply with----\n",
    "    Mr. Norman. And 10 weeks to get this letter that was two \n",
    "paragraphs long, is really an insult. Are you familiar with \n",
    "Meta Materials (MMTLP)?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Yes, I am, sir, not very deeply, but it is a \n",
    "company that I have heard of.\n",
    "    Mr. Norman. Do you know what the aggregate shares are, the \n",
    "audited shares count of MMTLP is as of close of market on \n",
    "December 8, 2022?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I don&#x27;t know. I know that it is a company that \n",
    "then exchanged into something called Next Bridge, I believe.\n",
    "    Mr. Norman. Okay. Does the SEC have this information on the \n",
    "audited shares?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It may be a matter of public record. It was a \n",
    "company that did an exchange and became another company.\n",

    "you would look into it, we would appreciate that.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Thank you.\n",
    "    Mr. Norman. As has been said earlier, the arbitrary \n",
    "rulemaking that is occurring under your rule on theoretical \n",
    "assumptions is really getting our constituents who are involved \n",
    "in the financial markets very upset. And considering your \n",
    "weight, you are going way past the boundaries that need to be \n",
    "going, and I think you have made the SEC a crusader of \n",
    "rulemaking by enforcement rather than modernizing the \n",
    "regulatory guidance which isn&#x27;t something new that you haven&#x27;t \n",
    "heard before. You blame it on staff turnover, you blame it on a \n",
    "lot of things, but my only request is that you prioritize this \n",
    "rulemaking and actually make the case for reductions, if you \n",
    "would even consider something. I yield back.\n",

    "a broker clearing agency, these are the kinds of things that \n",
    "should be registered. Is that a fair statement?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Yes. If you are a broker in America, if you \n",
    "are a dealer in an exchange, not only registered, but then \n",
    "comply with the laws so that the public is protected.\n",
    "    Mr. Green. And in your capacity as a chairman, if you have \n",

    "public?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Yes, and we end up being a cop on the beat, \n",

    "enforcement actions if people are not properly complying with \n",
    "the laws and registering.\n",
    "    Mr. Green. Public Citizen has indicated that crypto amounts \n",

    "of color. I am concerned about that. I appreciate your being \n",
    "the cop on the beat. I want to protect people from what may be \n",
    "a Ponzi scheme. There are different opinions about this, but \n",
    "what are some of the consequences of having a poorly-regulated \n",
    "digital currency?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. There have been billions of dollars of losses, \n",
    "and, in fact, there are some studies that suggest that lower-\n",
    "income communities and communities of color have lost more and \n",
    "that it has not been to their advantage at all to be investing \n",
    "in these assets, on average. Really, it is a matter of, the \n",
    "American public can decide what investment risks they want to \n",
    "take, but they should have the full and truthful disclosure \n",
    "about those investments if they are under the securities laws. \n",
    "And then, the trading platforms themselves should comply with \n",

    "customers on those exchanges.\n",
    "    Mr. Green. Do you consider the American dollar to be an \n",
    "effective, efficient digital currency?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. The American dollar, which is the sort of the \n",
    "leading currency around the globe, most of it is digital; we \n",
    "buy a cup of coffee at Starbucks or we get paid or we pay our \n",
    "rent digitally. Occasionally, we still use paper cash.\n",
    "    Mr. Green. And do you believe that properly regulated, we \n",
    "can have digital currencies that won&#x27;t amount to a Ponzi \n",
    "scheme?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I think the U.S. dollar is quite strong, and I \n",
    "think the U.S. dollar, because we use it digitally already, is \n",
    "a form of a digital dollar. Crypto tokens are really quite \n",
    "something different, sir. They are not a currency. This is \n",
    "going back into economic history, but they don&#x27;t fulfill the \n",
    "three functions of a currency: a store value; a unit of \n",
    "account; and a medium of exchange. Maybe in another day, but \n",
    "not in 2023, frankly.\n",
    "    Mr. Green. And our failure to act, or your failure because \n",
    "you are really the person who is in the hot seat, as it were, \n",
    "can cause a lot of harm to a lot of people, as we have seen \n",
    "with one circumstance, and I thank you for what you are doing \n",
    "to prevent that harm. I really do. Thank you.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Thank you.\n",

    "    This past summer, I asked Director Gerding, of your \n",
    "Division of Corporation Finance, about whether or not the SEC \n",
    "staff conducted legal analysis of shareholder proposals, and \n",
    "Director Gerding seemed to have a tough time answering the \n",
    "question. And I walked away understanding that the SEC does not \n",
    "conduct much of any legal analysis of a shareholder proposal. \n",
    "That is troubling to me because I think that should be one of \n",
    "the roles of the SEC, in particular, following the SEC&#x27;s review \n",
    "of the particular Travelers shareholder proposal, the racial \n",
    "equity audit that I think could have driven that company to be \n",
    "forced to engage in illegal behavior. So, I&#x27;m asking you if you \n",
    "can give me a clear answer, does the SEC conduct legal analysis \n",
    "of shareholder proposals?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. In preparation for the hearing, I watched the \n",
    "testimony between Director Gerding and you, and I don&#x27;t do this \n",
    "on a day-to-day basis. But I think when staff looks at \n",
    "sometimes companies come in and ask the staff&#x27;s opinion on \n",
    "things, one of the components they look at is the legal----\n",
    "    Mr. Steil. So, not every time. When you say, ``sometimes,&#x27;&#x27; \n",
    "I think it is just important for us to understand whether or \n",
    "not we should make that explicit. I think it should be \n",
    "explicit. So sometimes, the SEC looks at whether or not a \n",
    "shareholder proposal is legal and sometimes, they do not review \n",
    "whether or not a shareholder proposal is legal.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. As I understand it, I believe it is one of the \n",
    "components of the review, but I would be glad to have staff \n",
    "work with your staff and get you the details of the----\n",
    "    Mr. Steil. I would like you to. The fact that you reviewed \n",
    "it in advance of this committee hearing, which I appreciate the \n",
    "amount of time and effort you put into preparing for a hearing, \n",
    "but you don&#x27;t have an answer specifically to whether or not the \n",
    "SEC conducts a legal review, not even a legal opinion. But just \n",
    "a legal review on each shareholder proposal to me would be a \n",
    "baseline review for the SEC to conduct.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I am here saying I believe that it is part of \n",
    "the review, but I don&#x27;t know if it is on every shareholder \n",
    "proposal because it depends on the nature of the shareholder \n",
    "proposal, of course.\n",
    "    Mr. Steil. Okay. I would like you to come back with that \n",
    "information about the process in which you review shareholder \n",
    "proposals in light of probably two key things. One is, we \n",
    "brought in the two largest proxy advisers, ISS and Glass Lewis, \n",
    "and they specifically said on the record that they do not \n",
    "conduct a review for legality. They instead rely upon the SEC&#x27;s \n",
    "analysis for legality. On the record, in this committee room, \n",
    "Director Gerding, and now you, kind of go back and forth as to \n",
    "how you conduct that legal review. I think it is really \n",
    "important for us as policymakers to understand whether or not \n",
    "anyone, the SEC or proxy advisers, we can get to how they are \n",
    "registered with the SEC, but who is conducting the legal \n",
    "review, because it has a significant impact on companies.\n",
    "    And if we build upon that and we look at Staff Legal \n",
    "Bulletin No. 14L, we have seen a dramatic increase in the \n",
    "number of shareholder proposals. We are seeing more proposals \n",
    "focused on social and political concerns, and I go back and \n",
    "look at the underlying language of that legal staff bulletin \n",
    "saying that they would consider whether or not proposal concern \n",
    "is a matter of widespread public debate. Can you define, \n",
    "``widespread public debate?&#x27;&#x27;\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I think, sir, that it is really, and this goes \n",
    "back all the way back to the 1960s of shareholder proposals, \n",
    "that investors can make shareholder proposals on the term you \n",
    "used on widespread------\n",
    "    Mr. Steil. Widespread public debate is your legal staff \n",
    "bulletin.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. And that goes back many decades.\n",
    "    Mr. Steil. But can you define it? I understand there is a \n",
    "history to it, but the staff legal bulletin came out under your \n",
    "chairmanship. Can you define the term, ``widespread public \n",
    "debate?&#x27;&#x27;\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. The staff does, when asked, give their \n",
    "informal advice, but, ultimately, it is between the company and \n",
    "the investors.\n",
    "    Mr. Steil. Understood. But don&#x27;t you think that it is \n",
    "concerning that you can&#x27;t define what, ``widespread public \n",
    "debate,&#x27;&#x27; is when your staff bulletin says that is a point of \n",
    "review for shareholder proposals? I will offer you that it \n",
    "concerns me, in particular in light of the dramatic increase in \n",
    "the number of shareholder proposals we have seen that are based \n",
    "on social and political objectives rather than governance of \n",
    "the nation&#x27;s largest companies.\n",
    "    I will see if I can get this in really briefly. We have \n",
    "discussed your use of email. You have had an aggressive \n",
    "enforcement campaign on off-channel communications for \n",
    "financial firms. Have you used anything other than official SEC \n",
    "resources to conduct your government business?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. No, I comply with the laws, but also, if \n",
    "somebody sends me an email, then I forward it into the SEC.\n",
    "    Mr. Steil. Thank you very much for your time. I yield back.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from New York, Mr. \n",
    "Garbarino, is recognized for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Garbarino. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Gensler, \n",
    "thanks for coming today. The financial services sector, in the \n",
    "Biden Administration, has made harmonization of cyber incident \n",
    "reporting a top priority. In fact, the Department of Homeland \n",
    "Security&#x27;s Cyber Incident Reporting Council (CIRC) recently \n",
    "recommended that the Federal Government coordinate among \n",
    "themselves to reduce the burden on the reporting entity. But \n",
    "instead of reducing the burden, the SEC has finalized rules \n",
    "that CIRC has called, duplicative cross-sector reporting \n",
    "requirements that overlap with congressionally-mandated cyber \n",
    "incident reporting requirements in the Cyber Incident Reporting \n",
    "for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA). Given CIRCs \n",
    "designation, why didn&#x27;t the SEC harmonize its cybersecurity \n",
    "disclosure requirements with existing regulations, and, more \n",
    "importantly, wait until the Department of Homeland Security \n",
    "(DHS) and the Center for Internet Security (CIS) developed the \n",
    "rulemaking under the recently-signed-into-law CIRCIA?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. One, we have had good discussions with the \n",
    "Department of Homeland Security, but we finalized the corporate \n",
    "disclosure piece because it was important for the public \n",
    "investors to know if there had been a material cyber breach.\n",
    "    Mr. Garbarino. Is investor information more important than \n",
    "Homeland Security? And I ask that question because the reason \n",
    "we want to harmonize, and the reason we as a Congress have said \n",
    "to harmonize, and the reason the Biden Administration has said \n",
    "to harmonize these incident reporting rules is because we have \n",
    "heard from the private sector that their cyber employees are \n",
    "spending 40 to 50 percent of their time--and we have spoken \n",
    "about this before--on complying with cyber regulations, not \n",
    "just yours, but with all sorts of different cyber regulations.\n",
    "    And we talked about this the last time you were here, \n",
    "specifically the rule that was just finalized in July, and you \n",
    "said at the time that you had been having good discussions with \n",
    "DHS. But, again, this rule came out, and DHS said that, ``This \n",
    "current rule is duplicative cross-sector reporting.&#x27;&#x27; It is a \n",
    "duplicative cross-sector reporting requirement. So even though \n",
    "you have had good conversations, I guess they didn&#x27;t lead \n",
    "anywhere, because you still came out with the rule.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Actually, it did, because it is only reporting \n",
    "to the public if it is a material cyber event. It is 4 business \n",
    "days, which actually is longer than CIRCIA&#x27;s 72 hours, and it \n",
    "has important considerations in there that if the Department of \n",
    "Justice thinks for reasons of national security or public \n",
    "safety, it should be delayed, it will be delayed.\n",
    "    Mr. Garbarino. It is longer. Four days is longer, but \n",
    "within material breaches, there are different requirements \n",
    "there. I have to ask, because there is also concern that you \n",
    "have companies that are reporting a possible material \n",
    "cybersecurity breach that might not have been able to fix that \n",
    "breach, and if they are publicly reporting it, it could: one, \n",
    "put that company at further risk; or two, put other companies \n",
    "using the same system at risk because the same backdoor can be \n",
    "found. We just saw over the summer there was an attack on a \n",
    "company, they announced this attack before the patch was \n",
    "released, and you saw other companies and three Federal \n",
    "agencies get hacked under the same vulnerability.\n",
    "    So I am concerned that having this public reporting before \n",
    "the breach is fixed, before the patch is fixed, is going to \n",

    "    Mr. Lawler. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chair Gensler, you \n",
    "have embarked on a rapid and extensive campaign to reform every \n",
    "facet of our markets. It is evident that your rules will \n",
    "significantly change our markets. For example, your equity \n",
    "market structure rules will impact all retail investors, \n",
    "encompassing over 228 million retail accounts. The swing \n",
    "pricing rule will have implications for every mutual fund, \n",
    "involving over 100 million American investors. The climate rule \n",
    "imposes new costs on every public company. The predictive \n",
    "analytics rule will encompass virtually every type of \n",
    "technology. The private funds rule fundamentally reshapes the \n",
    "regulation of private institutions in a potentially unlawful \n",
    "manner. The pace and scope of your rules is unprecedented. Have \n",
    "you taken the time to do a comprehensive economic analysis \n",
    "examining the cumulative impacts of all of these rulemakings on \n",
    "the markets and the broader economy?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Representative Lawler, actually our pace is \n",
    "about the same as prior Administrations and----\n",
    "    Mr. Lawler. Respectfully, we can disagree on that, and that \n",
    "is not what I asked you. I asked you a very specific question. \n",
    "Have you taken the time to do a comprehensive economic analysis \n",
    "to examine the cumulative impact of all of these rulemakings on \n",
    "the markets and the broader economy? Yes or no?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. On each of the rules, we do a robust economic \n",
    "analysis, and then if another rule is finalized, we incorporate \n",
    "that. We take into consideration that interaction in the \n",
    "possible further rulemaking and adjust the economic baselines.\n",
    "    Mr. Lawler. So, you are saying for the record that you have \n",
    "taken the time to do comprehensive economic analysis, examine \n",
    "the cumulative impact of all of these rulemakings on the market \n",
    "and the broader economy? Yes or no?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. For the record, what we do is we take into \n",
    "consideration as and if a rule is finalized the interaction \n",
    "with other rules as it changes what is called the economic \n",
    "baseline.\n",
    "    Mr. Lawler. Yes. So, have you done the cumulative impact? \n",
    "Have you studied that? Have you done an economic analysis on \n",
    "all of it?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We do them rule by rule individually. And \n",
    "also, the interaction as it relates to other rules. If we were \n",
    "to finalize a rule, then we take that in consideration and----\n",
    "    Mr. Lawler. Can you explain your engagement with market \n",
    "participants before putting out significant rule proposals? Are \n",
    "you holding public roundtables?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We meet with the public extensively before the \n",
    "equity market rules. We had numerous meetings from when I came \n",
    "on in the summer of 2021 all the way through December of 2022.\n",
    "    Mr. Lawler. Chair Gensler, California Governor Newsom \n",
    "recently confirmed his intention to sign two bills mandating \n",
    "climate disclosure into law. You mentioned to the press last \n",
    "week that the SEC staff is, ``going to take a look if it were \n",
    "to become law because it may change some of the economic \n",
    "baseline for our rule.&#x27;&#x27; It is evident that the law will indeed \n",
    "alter the economics of your rule. So, can you make a commitment \n",
    "to allowing the public an opportunity to provide feedback on \n",
    "the Commission&#x27;s updated economic analysis before finalizing \n",
    "the rule?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We take the comments into consideration. We \n",
    "have had 16,000 comments, a lot of comments on the economics, \n",
    "and we often will adapt based on those comments.\n",
    "    Mr. Lawler. No, no, no. What I am asking you is, based on \n",
    "the reevaluation, based on the potential change in law, will \n",
    "you commit to allowing the public an opportunity to provide \n",
    "feedback on the Commission&#x27;s updated economic analysis before \n",
    "finalizing the rule?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I would say this. We are compelled. This is an \n",
    "important thing.\n",
    "    Mr. Lawler. It is a pretty straightforward question. Will \n",
    "you allow the public to comment on the updated economic \n",
    "analysis before finalizing the rule? Yes or no?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We would put it----\n",
    "    Mr. Lawler. Sir?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. If we finalize a rule, it would be part of \n",
    "that finalized rule.\n",
    "    Mr. Lawler. Okay. I know you would like to obfuscate, but I \n",
    "am honestly asking you a very straightforward question.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Sir, I understand where you are heading.\n",
    "    Mr. Lawler. Can you commit?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. No. The answer is, no.\n",
    "    Mr. Lawler. So, you won&#x27;t commit. Thank you. At least, you \n",
    "answered the question. Thank you. I want to touch on another \n",
    "factor here. The SEC recently proposed amendments to expand and \n",
    "update regulation systems&#x27; compliance and integrity. The \n",
    "proposal would expand the scope of Regulation Systems \n",
    "Compliance and Integrity (Reg SCI) entities to include certain \n",
    "registered broker-dealers for the first time. Feedback from \n",
    "market participants on this proposal suggests that the actual \n",
    "costs for this proposal are in the billions of dollars as a \n",
    "result of the SEC attempting to micromanage the technology \n",
    "setup of individual firms, yet these enormous compliance costs \n",
    "are conveniently absent from the SEC&#x27;s cost-benefit analysis. \n",
    "Why did the Commission fail to acknowledge these costs in its \n",
    "economic analysis?\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. Chair \n",
    "Gensler, please respond in written form.\n",
    "    Mr. Lawler. Thank you.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. We will now go to the gentleman from \n",
    "Iowa, Mr. Nunn, for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Nunn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Gensler, thank \n",
    "you, and welcome back to the committee. I know each time, we \n",
    "get to have a lot of questions on this. The last time we spoke, \n",
    "I addressed swing pricing and hard close proposals with you. I \n",
    "also want to reemphasize here the devastating impact that has \n",
    "had on many of my hardworking constituents from their \n",
    "retirement plans, their 401(k)s, my nurses with 457 plans, my \n",
    "teachers with 403(b) plans; I think you get the gist of where \n",
    "we are going with this. As you are well aware after this \n",
    "morning&#x27;s rule, I believe it needs to be withdrawn, and I look \n",
    "forward to your team&#x27;s response to both Chairwoman Wagner and \n",
    "Ranking Member Sherman on the letter that we signed on to and \n",
    "are still waiting to hear back on.\n",
    "    But I want to talk specifically here about the agricultural \n",
    "and small business communities that I represent. The extra \n",
    "regulations that the SEC is potentially proposing in this \n",
    "regulation under the guise of consumer protection are going to \n",
    "add $6 billion in ncreased annualized cost to the industry, and \n",
    "an additional 6 million compliance hours, many of these being \n",
    "small family farms and mid-sized Main Street businesses. I hope \n",
    "you appreciate this has a tremendous impact on my constituents \n",
    "back home. Along with four other members of the House \n",
    "Agriculture Committee, on which I serve, we have signed a \n",
    "letter here moving forward a conversation, which brings me to \n",
    "my question on the February 15th proposal rulemaking on \n",
    "safeguarding client assets aimed at reshaping custody assets.\n",
    "    As you know, we worked hard with you in your former role \n",
    "with the CFTC on how this can be successful, but dozens of \n",
    "trade groups have signed up and identified that this rulemaking \n",
    "would represent trillions of dollars of assets that our \n",
    "constituents back home face. Both of these letters, Mr. \n",
    "Chairman, highlight significant errors with the proposed \n",
    "rulemaking, and I am going to begin this conversation by asking \n",
    "you to consider withdrawing it until these things get fixed. \n",
    "Your definitions of, ``custody,&#x27;&#x27; and, ``asset,&#x27;&#x27; would expand \n",
    "so greatly that they would encompass derivatives and future \n",
    "markets that have been overseen by the CFTC, your former \n",
    "organization, for decades. So with these bipartisan letters \n",
    "specifically, I believe that they would upend our markets \n",
    "overseen by the CFTC, eroding their essential risk management \n",
    "functions and putting our nation&#x27;s farmers and producers at \n",
    "risk.\n",
    "    Now, Chairman Gensler, in your 432-page proposal on \n",
    "economic analysis, do you know how many times, ``agriculture,&#x27;&#x27; \n",
    "was mentioned as part of this review?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I don&#x27;t recall, but I suspect you are going to \n",
    "let me know.\n",
    "    Mr. Nunn. Would it surprise you to know, not once? In fact, \n",
    "it was only mentioned as a subcategory within a footnote. \n",
    "Clearly, this is concerning, particularly for my farming \n",
    "constituents, but this is something the CFTC has been doing for \n",
    "decades. So Chair Gensler, earlier you answered Representative \n",
    "Lucas&#x27; question. Has there been any coordination with the SEC \n",
    "and the CFTC on this issue?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Yes, we have been in dialogue, but prior to \n",
    "the proposal in subsection, there is a proposal, and I think \n",
    "that----\n",
    "    Mr. Nunn. Can I get some specifics on that? When did you \n",
    "send a request over to the CFTC for this coordination: the day \n",
    "before the proposal; a week before the proposal; or after the \n",
    "proposal was already out?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Representative, it is usually just a staff-to-\n",
    "staff dialogue.\n",
    "    Mr. Nunn. Great. I look forward to your staff providing me \n",
    "the date on which you actually asked for this information from \n",
    "the CFTC. Did the CFTC provide you with any recommendations on \n",
    "your rulemaking?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We engaged with multiple Federal regulators on \n",
    "this rule, and we will continue to do that, because we have \n",
    "been happy to have feedback.\n",
    "    Mr. Nunn. I am very happy to hear that, Mr. Chairman. I \n",
    "would like to see that feedback being transparently provided to \n",
    "this committee then. Did you read these comments, and were they \n",
    "incorporated into your final proposal?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Sir, we haven&#x27;t finalized a proposal yet.\n",
    "    Mr. Nunn. Did you incorporate any CFTC recommendations?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We haven&#x27;t finalized an adoption yet.\n",
    "    Mr. Nunn. Mr. Chairman, did you incorporate any of the CFTC \n",
    "proposals into your recommendation?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We have put out to public comment to get \n",
    "feedback, and we get feedback and it is benefiting this, and I \n",
    "think that we can----\n",
    "    Mr. Nunn. I haven&#x27;t heard anything about the CFTC on this. \n",
    "You are putting it out to the public, which brings me to my \n",
    "next question. It is my understanding that you recently \n",
    "reopened the comment period without re-proposing the rules. \n",
    "Specifically, what value does this add to the agricultural \n",
    "community and my constituents for their grave concerns if you \n",
    "are reopening it but you are not listening to the CFTC, the \n",
    "Agriculture Committee, or even what is happening on a \n",
    "bipartisan basis within this committee?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I think we reopened this because we had \n",
    "another role that may intersect with this, the discussion we \n",
    "have had a lot here today. And so, we reopened it formally to \n",
    "get further comment.\n",
    "    Mr. Nunn. It might suggest to some that you didn&#x27;t get the \n",
    "answers you wanted, so you reopened it to others. Let me end \n",
    "with this: I urge you to withdraw this rule, as my bipartisan, \n",
    "bicameral colleagues have argued the same. Thank you, Mr. \n",
    "Chairman. I yield back.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Thank you. It was good to see you.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman from Florida, Mr. Donalds, \n",
    "is now recognized for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Donalds. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Gensler, \n",
    "welcome back. Do you remember where we left off, you and I?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I do. You are a very good questioner, sir. I \n",
    "remember it.\n",
    "    Mr. Donalds. Okay. Let&#x27;s bring some things up. Where we \n",
    "left off was, did you facilitate the payment for the Steele \n",
    "dossier for the Hillary Clinton campaign back in 2016, because \n",
    "you were the CFO? You acknowledge that. You also said in \n",
    "response to my question that, ``This payment was not something \n",
    "that I was aware of.&#x27;&#x27; Those are your words. Interesting things \n",
    "have occurred since then.\n",
    "    John Podesta actually testified to a committee of Congress \n",
    "and John Podesta testified to a question about, was Gary--\n",
    "meaning you--day to day, hands-on signing every check. \n",
    "Actually, he was under a deposition with a committee here in \n",
    "Congress. He says, ``Yes, I don&#x27;t know if he signed the checks, \n",
    "but he was there every day,&#x27;&#x27; meaning you. So, let&#x27;s circle \n",
    "back. Were you aware of the fact that the Hillary Clinton \n",
    "campaign actually paid for the Steele dossier, which unleashed \n",
    "one of the worst issues of intelligence malfeasance that our \n",
    "nation has ever seen?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Sir, I answered this 6 months ago, and it is \n",
    "the same answer today. No.\n",
    "    Mr. Donalds. You weren&#x27;t aware of what was going on? Mr. \n",
    "Gensler, I find that very interesting, because if I listen to \n",
    "some of the people, the staff who have left the SEC, you are \n",
    "very aware of everything that is going on. It is actually your \n",
    "MO. You are very hands-on. So, you are going to tell this \n",
    "committee right now that you had no idea that the Hillary \n",
    "Clinton campaign, of which you were the CFO, sent money to \n",
    "Perkins Coie for a dossier that was phony and led to the spying \n",
    "on of a Presidential campaign in 2016? You were not aware of \n",
    "any of this?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Sir, as a chief financial officer in a \n",
    "political campaign, I was not aware of what a law firm was \n",
    "doing with some of the monies that they got.\n",
    "    Mr. Donalds. I find that interesting because in some of \n",
    "your other rhetoric about CFOs in the public sector and the \n",
    "private sector of our economy, you are very tough on CFOs. You \n",
    "have said on the record on many occasions that CFOs have a \n",
    "fiduciary responsibility to the organizations that they cover, \n",
    "that they should be aware of everything that is going on. So, \n",
    "how is that a standard you hold CFOs to in the private sector \n",
    "but you don&#x27;t hold yourself to that same standard?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. That is not a standard that the SEC holds CFOs \n",
    "to. It is about their financials, and that the financials are \n",
    "put together in accordance with GAAP, and that the numbers are \n",
    "accurate, and that they are----\n",
    "    Mr. Donalds. Did you accurately pay for the Steele dossier \n",
    "out of the Hillary Clinton campaign?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Sir, I learned about that way after President \n",
    "Trump was the President and Hillary Clinton was a private \n",
    "citizen.\n",
    "    Mr. Donalds. Okay. Let&#x27;s move on. We will probably circle \n",
    "back to that another time. I want to reference a story in \n",
    "Capital Account from June 13th. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous \n",
    "consent for the story to be entered into the record.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n",
    "    Mr. Donalds. The story notes that you met with Senator \n",
    "Tammy Baldwin in May about the SEC&#x27;s proposal related to the \n",
    "13D beneficial ownership disclosure, at which time you \n",
    "allegedly and Senator Baldwin staff allegedly--I am going to \n",
    "say allegedly--contacted an organization called, We The \n",
    "Investors, to submit comment letters in favor of the 13D \n",
    "proposal. Subsequently, the SEC was flooded with 350-plus \n",
    "comment letters from so-called individuals, but mostly form \n",
    "letters stamped with the moniker, We The Investors, in favor of \n",
    "their proposal. It appears to me that you have engaged in \n",
    "astroturfing to advance your own agenda. Is this true? If this \n",
    "is true, it is a serious breach of impartiality that would \n",
    "violate the spirit, if not the letter, of the law of the \n",
    "Administrative Procedure Act.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Sir, again, I don&#x27;t know what the press is \n",
    "talking about. I remember the meeting with the Senator was a \n",
    "good, thoughtful----\n",
    "    Mr. Donalds. Did you meet with Senator Baldwin in May with \n",
    "respect to 13D?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I think that it is on my public calendar that \n",
    "I met with Senator Baldwin. I meet with Senators and \n",
    "Representatives on a regular basis.\n",
    "    Mr. Donalds. Okay. I need to get from your public calendar \n",
    "if you actually met with Senator Baldwin. I think the committee \n",
    "would like to know that. In this meeting with Senator Baldwin&#x27;s \n",
    "staff, did you speak to an organization called, We The \n",
    "Investors?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I have no memory of that.\n",
    "    Mr. Donalds. Mr. Gensler, the no-memory routine from a lot \n",
    "of appointees is really getting old. You all are discussing and \n",
    "leading some of the various regulations facing our economy, so \n",
    "to come before a committee of Congress and have no idea what \n",
    "you talked to with a Senator&#x27;s staff member about 13D----\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. The meeting was with the Senator, sir.\n",
    "    Mr. Donalds. Okay. If you don&#x27;t remember, if you don&#x27;t \n",
    "recall what she said, a United States Senator, about key issues \n",
    "facing our economy from a regulatory basis----\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. Sir, no. Please, sir.\n",
    "    Mr. Donalds. ----that is a real problem, don&#x27;t you think?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. You are a good questioner, but please, sir, \n",
    "that story is not one that I would confirm. It is not a story \n",
    "that I believe is accurate.\n",
    "    Mr. Donalds. Let me ask you a question. Broad-based, do you \n",
    "think it is appropriate for the Chairman of the SEC or, \n",
    "frankly, the head of any agency to engage with outside groups \n",
    "to accomplish the agenda they want to see through rulemaking?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We are responsible under the Administrative \n",
    "Procedure Act to hear from outside parties, market \n",
    "participants, constituents in your districts, and Members of \n",
    "Congress.\n",
    "    Mr. Donalds. No, that is not my question. We want to hear \n",
    "from outside groups.\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. We are obligated----\n",
    "    Mr. Donalds. Is it okay to engage with outside groups to \n",
    "help you accomplish what you want to see?\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentleman&#x27;s time has expired. The \n",
    "gentleman&#x27;s time has expired.\n",
    "    Mr. Donalds. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. The gentlelady from Indiana, Mrs. \n",
    "Houchin, is recognized for 5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mrs. Houchin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member \n",
    "Waters, and thank you to Chairman Gensler for speaking with us \n",
    "today.\n",
    "    Chair Gensler, under the last Democrat Chair of the SEC, \n",
    "Mary Jo White, the Commission adhered closely to the statutory \n",
    "authority of Congress. During her time as Chair, 59 percent of \n",
    "the SEC&#x27;s proposals were mandated by Congress. By contrast, \n",
    "under your leadership, only 17 percent of the Commission&#x27;s \n",
    "proposals are mandated by Congress, according to a report from \n",
    "Professor Hal Scott of Harvard. Why is there such a rush under \n",
    "your chairmanship to promulgate so many rules without specific \n",
    "mandates from Congress?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It is because technology and the markets have \n",
    "changed so much. She was coming in as Chair right after a \n",
    "financial crisis, so naturally, there were, I think, 120 \n",
    "mandates that Congress placed, but you are accurate, and we \n",
    "have picked up about 10 of those from the Dodd-Frank Act, and \n",
    "one from the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act.\n",
    "    Mrs. Houchin. Chair Gensler, there is a perception that the \n",
    "SEC is neglecting public input, particularly bipartisan letters \n",
    "that Members of Congress have sent to voice valid concerns \n",
    "regarding individual rules and the rulemaking process. The \n",
    "concerns encompass the bipartisan concerns about insufficient \n",
    "comment periods and a general response to bipartisan concerns \n",
    "regarding proposals on swing pricing, liquidity risk \n",

    "similar bipartisan concerns being raised with previous SEC \n",
    "Chairs? If not, could you elaborate on why the opinions of \n",
    "Congress don&#x27;t factor into your consideration?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. The opinions of Congress most definitely \n",
    "factor into my consideration.\n",
    "    Mrs. Houchin. It doesn&#x27;t seem so, Mr. Chairman. It does not \n",
    "seem so, when only 17 percent of the proposals that you have \n",
    "brought forth are the result of mandates from Congress. I find \n",
    "it incredibly frustrating that anytime we provide comment or \n",
    "send what we call strongly-worded letters about our opinions on \n",
    "how the SEC should behave, it seems like these must be \n",
    "immediately thrown in the trash and disregarded.\n",
    "    I want to turn to Reg SCI. The SEC originally adopted \n",
    "Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity, otherwise known as \n",
    "Reg SCI, in 2014, in response to several market disruptions at \n",
    "national securities exchanges. Earlier this year, the \n",
    "Commission proposed to expand Reg SCI to certain broker-\n",
    "dealers. However, unlike in 2014, the Commission fails to \n",
    "provide a single instance of a broker-dealer systems disruption \n",
    "that had a significant market-wide impact in the securities \n",
    "markets. In fact, the SEC&#x27;s own proposal acknowledges that \n",
    "broker-dealer systems performed well during the unprecedented \n",
    "trading volumes and volatility at the height of the COVID-19 \n",
    "pandemic. Further, the Commission admits that it, ``finds it \n",
    "impracticable to quantify the many benefits associated with \n",
    "amended Regulation SCI.&#x27;&#x27; Once again, this seems like the \n",
    "Commission is providing a solution in search of a problem.\n",
    "    Chairman Gensler, given that the Commission cannot point to \n",
    "a single broker-dealer systems disruption or any tangible \n",
    "benefits to applying Reg SCI to broker-dealers, how can you \n",
    "justify that proposal?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. As we outlined in the proposal itself, which \n",
    "is still out for public comment, some broker-dealers may have \n",
    "such size and scale and standing in the markets that if they \n",
    "were taken down, that could be disruptive to the markets. That \n",
    "is the important thing, and these so-called systems&#x27; compliance \n",
    "integrity is about those most consequential or central parts of \n",
    "the market.\n",
    "    Mrs. Houchin. The SEC&#x27;s Regulatory Flexibility Agenda for \n",
    "2023 indicates that you intend to finalize a proposed \n",
    "rulemaking to expand the definition of an exchange in short \n",
    "order. Although the SEC has reopened this rulemaking, the \n",
    "proposed rule is still fraught with insufficient economic \n",
    "analysis and ill-defining scope, among other things. Given \n",
    "Congress&#x27; ongoing and unaddressed concerns with the rulemaking, \n",
    "as well as concerns of hundreds of stakeholders, it seems \n",
    "irresponsible for the SEC to finalize this rulemaking. Could \n",
    "you comment on the expected timeline for finalization of this \n",
    "rule?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. You will be pleased to hear that we don&#x27;t do \n",
    "it against a clock. It is really when we get the comments and \n",
    "the economics right and the legal authorities right and then \n",
    "discuss it with the Commissioners.\n",
    "    Mrs. Houchin. And finally, I want to raise an alarming \n",
    "issue that I think needs further attention: The timing of \n",
    "various actions by the SEC while Congress is seeking to \n",
    "establish a regulatory framework on digital assets. To name a \n",
    "few, on January 12, 2023, this committee announced the \n",
    "formation of the Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and \n",
    "Inclusion Subcommittee. It was subsequently announced that the \n",
    "SEC pursued enforcement actions against two firms.\n",
    "    On March 9, 2023, the committee hosted its first hearing on \n",
    "the Biden Administration&#x27;s approach to digital assets. An hour \n",
    "before the hearing, you published an op-ed in The Hill.\n",
    "    On April 27, 2023, the committee hosted another hearing on \n",
    "digital asset regulation. You tweeted an, ``Office Hours,&#x27;&#x27; \n",
    "video on your view that most digital assets are securities.\n",
    "    And on May 3, 2023, this committee and the House \n",
    "Agriculture Committee, led by my colleague Chairman Thompson, \n",
    "announced our first joint hearing on digital asset legislation, \n",
    "which was unprecedented. You published another, ``Office \n",
    "Hours.&#x27;&#x27;\n",
    "    I am not one to connect dots, but it seems like you are \n",
    "actively trying to undermine the work of Congress. You must not \n",
    "impede our work to do our job, even though you won&#x27;t do yours. \n",
    "I yield back.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. Would the gentleman care to respond?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I very much respect the work of this \n",
    "committee, and particularly the work of this committee around \n",
    "crypto assets. We have a robust time because this is a field \n",
    "that is rife with fraud and abuse, so our enforcement agenda \n",
    "sometimes does roll out while you are doing your good work here \n",
    "as well.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. Mr. Ogles of Tennessee is recognized for \n",
    "5 minutes.\n",
    "    Mr. Ogles. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Gensler, thank you \n",
    "for being here. I do want to echo the chairman and support the \n",
    "chairman that I think we have come to this crossroads where \n",
    "subpoenas may be necessary. It seems that compliance in \n",
    "requests for information and documentation has been kind of \n",
    "shortcoming, and so with that, Mr. Chairman, you have my full \n",
    "support when and if you decide to move forward.\n",
    "    But, Mr. Gensler, one of the things that concerns me is \n",
    "sometimes this subjective or perception of subjective and \n",
    "arbitrary nature of the rules. On May 25, 2022, the SEC \n",
    "proposed amending the Names Rule to further regulate the names \n",
    "of investment funds. I think everyone would agree that it is \n",
    "misleading. The fund called the Mexico Growth Fund made most of \n",
    "its investments in Japanese value stocks. Many names may be \n",
    "subject to differences of opinion. The proposal specifically \n",
    "mentions ESG funds. Mr. Gensler, is the SEC equipped to \n",
    "determine what, broadly speaking, is good for the environment \n",
    "as it pertains to ESG?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. No, sir, we are not an environmental \n",
    "regulator.\n",
    "    Mr. Ogles. Again, going back to the subjective nature of \n",
    "some of the rules and the compliance that is forced, it is kind \n",
    "of like, what is better for our environment, paper or plastic \n",
    "bags? And when we should be focusing more on the fiduciary \n",
    "aspects of a fund versus its environmental compliance, I have \n",
    "concerns. When you look at the social component of ESG, whom \n",
    "would you entrust, or how will you determine whether or not a \n",
    "company is compliant with the social portion of ESG?\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. In terms of this Names Rule, it was basically \n",
    "truth in advertising, that if you are going to say you are a \n",
    "social fund, to use that, you have to actually then describe \n",
    "what the marketer of that fund means by, ``social,&#x27;&#x27; and then \n",
    "ensure that you invest as you are marketing to the public. This \n",
    "was really a rule, in most regards, the Names Rule adopted in \n",
    "2020, 3 years ago, to protect the investing public, to ensure \n",
    "that the advisers they pick are doing what they say and saying \n",
    "what they mean.\n",
    "    Mr. Ogles. But again, to my point, this creates a very \n",
    "subjective nature to the rules process, because you just said \n",
    "that basically, you don&#x27;t have the capability to judge the \n",
    "environmental components. You don&#x27;t have the capability to \n",
    "judge the social component. So, if there is a clear definition \n",
    "and disclosure in the prospectus, who is to determine whether \n",
    "or not they are compliant? And you now have a rule that can be \n",
    "abused or a rule that is completely useless. So why even have \n",
    "the rule, when at the end of the day it should be about----\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It is sort of like, as one of my fellow \n",
    "Commissioners said when we voted on this rule, to ensure that \n",
    "if you say you are selling pepperoni pizza, there is actually \n",
    "pepperoni on the pizza.\n",
    "    Mr. Ogles. I like pepperoni pizza, don&#x27;t get me wrong. But \n",
    "yes, and forgive me, these rules outlive any given \n",
    "Administration, but under this current Administration, the \n",
    "Biden Administration doesn&#x27;t necessarily have the greatest \n",
    "track record of trust with word definitions. And I don&#x27;t mean \n",
    "to be contrarian here, but if the Administration can&#x27;t figure \n",
    "out what a woman is, how do I trust them to have any kind of \n",
    "bearing or judgment on----\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. I totally understand what you are saying. What \n",
    "adopted in a Names Rule is that if you are marketing to the \n",
    "public that you are, let&#x27;s say, environmental or a green fund, \n",
    "you describe what that means. You can describe what a pepperoni \n",
    "pizza is, but if you describe it, you better comply with it.\n",
    "    Mr. Ogles. But again, I just----\n",
    "    Mr. Gensler. It is a fund manager&#x27;s----\n",
    "    Mr. Ogles. When you look at, for example, the climate \n",
    "disclosure and the burden that is being put on businesses to \n",
    "track their supply chains, you are now creating an enforcement \n",
    "mechanism that the company has to enforce on its supply chain. \n",
    "Again, these rules that you are pushing on businesses, that you \n",
    "are pushing on these instruments, only do one thing: drive up \n",
    "costs. And at the end of the day, the end user, the very people \n",
    "that you are trying to protect, you are hurting, because of the \n",
    "arbitrary nature of the rules that you have put in place. It is \n",
    "very frustrating.\n",
    "    And again, Mr. Chairman, I am about out of time, but I am \n",
    "just going to say that I would say open up the floodgates, hit \n",
    "him with subpoenas, and get the information we need. The \n",
    "obfuscation and not answering questions, I am sick and tired of \n",
    "it. I have sat back here, and I have listened to this entire \n",
    "hearing. You wear tap dancing shoes better than Fred Astaire, \n",
    "and enough is enough. And I don&#x27;t mean any disrespect, but it \n",
    "is time the questions are answered so that we have the \n",
    "information we need. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.\n",
    "    Chairman McHenry. Thank you.\n",
    "    Thank you, Chairman Gensler. It is 2:29, so it is not your \n",
    "longest day in a committee, but thank you for being here.\n",
    "    As I stated at the outset, it is my request of you and your \n",
    "agency to comply with our requests as a committee. I don&#x27;t want \n",
    "to use the compulsory process for the first time in our history \n",
    "between this House of Representatives, this committee, and your \n",
    "agency, so I think it would be a purposeful act on your part if \n",
    "it resulted in us issuing a subpoena.\n",
    "    The Chair notes that some Members may have additional \n",

Да, это, наверное, вообще не моё.\\nON (54):  Прикольно, сколько у меня тут всего интересного.\\nON (55):  А что же они, получается, всё время ходят по одной и той же ссылке?\\nON (56):  ссылки и она у меня подгружается ну ладно\\nnan (57):  Там, где есть.\\nnan (58):  А, да?\\nDG (59):  Есть.\\nON (60):  И это причем тоже, мне кажется, встреча, на которой меня не было.\\nON (61):  Да.\\nON (62):  Видишь?\\nON (63):  А она у меня висит.\\nDG (64):  может быть а я еще но я что муж может быть да не я там Я там механизм шаринга тоже разрабатывал, для того, чтобы можно было все там или какой-то кусок встречи своих передать, чтобы было...\\nDG (65):  У человека.\\nON (66):  Ну, у меня сейчас вот...\\nON (67):  Что у меня сейчас по workflow?\\nON (68):  Во-первых, на английских встречах я периодически пользуюсь вживую.\\nON (69):  когда у людей какой-нибудь безумный акцент, и это реально помогает.\\nON (70):  И я пока, короче, я не вижу аналогов.\\nON (71):  То есть я же потестила из-за того, что у меня сейчас Zoom еще, добавился я потестил много других вариантов от и просто выносит мозг своим подключением к календарю это ужасная система Тактик, ну, в принципе, они нормальные, но тоже как бы неудобно, потому что вот то, что у нас ты можешь просто взять «включить на встречу» и «выключить за встречу», Я сейчас понимаю, что это на самом деле преимущество, потому что это очень удобно.\\nON (72):  И у нас было, по-моему, пару человек, которые тоже про это говорили, что вот эти вот синки с календарем, это не ну не всегда это надо короче говоря и вот и много у кого типа ты подключаешь какой-то тот же fireflies и он к тебе ходит на все встречи надо не надо Не надо, ты никак не можешь их убить.\\nON (73):  Это просто какой-то ад кошмарный.\\nON (74):  Но для зума я сейчас использую Джейми и тактик получается.\\nON (75):  но не у другого нету а ну нету тактика есть онлайн субтитры но они тоже какие-то короче неудобная вот эта система немножко не знаю знаю, в общем, не так как-то пользоваться прямо во время встречи.\\nON (76):  Вот.\\nON (77):  Что еще?\\nON (78):  В самой вексе...\\nDG (79):  Самое интересное я не посмотрел.\\nDG (80):  А? А у нас?\\nDG (81):  Самое интересное я не посмотрел.\\nDG (82):  А, ну подожди, еще раз.\\nDG (83):  Это уже показатель того, что не очевидно, где там самое интересное.\\nON (84):  так она что я не посмотрела типа чат посмотрим что там было с лицензией на транскрипт inscrito, ok.\\nON (85):  У меня с ней пустой.\\nON (86):  Так.\\nON (87):  И что я должна здесь делать?\\nON (88):  Я должна попроучить.\\nnan (89):  Мопочек не хватает.\\nON (90):  Кнопка было бы здесь проще.\\nON (91):  Так, ну ладно, какой-то summary.\\nON (92):  Ну, в принципе, норм, ладно.\\nON (93):  Я бы пощёлкала ещё вот на эти, типа, на имя.\\nON (94):  Ну, а больше я не понимаю, что ещё я могу здесь делать.\\nDG (95):  не понятно что эта кнопка слева вверху слева вверху вот это глобус\\nON (96):  непонятно нет вообще не понятно что сейчас я поняла уж конечно про что это типа мне по всем встречам что-то поискать поискать ну хорошо давай посмотрим\\nDG (97):  По всем проиндексированным, да, то есть индексация там идет, встреч много.\\nON (98):  Нет ее, да? Значит, она не проиндексировалась, получается, да?\\nON (99):  Да.\\nON (100):  Ну, вот знаешь, я когда еще тестила в прошлый раз, Мне кажется, надо как-то ограничивать, типа, по каким встречам надо искать, потому что, ну, вот, например, мне же не надо...\\nON (101):  Например, какие-то промпты спрашивала про пользователей, а он ищет по всем встречам.\\nON (102):  Он выдает в том числе наши с тобой обсуждения и добавляет в их информацию равноценную, каздевом с пользователями.\\nON (103):  А это не совсем корректно получается.\\nON (104):  Ну и вообще, конечно, здесь очень сложно понять, что здесь надо тебе делать.\\nON (105):  Да, нужно тоже кнопочки.\\nON (106):  Нужны кнопочки и нужен какой-то... Я даже думаю, что здесь может... Не знаю даже, что здесь. Нужен какой-то workflow, что ли? Как это...\\nON (107):  Типа, что ты в принципе здесь можешь поделать, какие вопросы порешать.\\nON (108):  Посмотрим. Давай вот так потестим.\\nON (109):  И Global Search, кажется, что это может быть что-то про поисковик.\\nON (110):  Он же не уходит в сеть, то есть он ищет только по встречам.\\nON (111):  непонятно даже а вот еще давай посмотрим у меня а вот смотри вот это вот вообще как бы некорректно получилось откуда здесь векс взялась Типа, почему он вообще на это ссылается?\\nON (112):  Эта встреча вообще не про это.\\nON (113):  Видишь?\\nDG (114):  Ну, да, да.\\nDG (115):  Ну, это на результаты, видишь, не влияет.\\nON (116):  А вот эти вот интересно стали работать штуки?\\nON (117):  14 октября и на что\\nDG (118):  что он там сослался неправильно почему-то показывает неправильную дату интересно почему да не то он показывает а вот эту\\nON (119):  Кто все эти люди?\\nDG (120):  Очень старинная, скорее всего, и неправильную дату показывает. Интересно, почему неправильную дату?\\nON (121):  Да, а какая дата-то?\\nON (122):  ...это их встреча. А почему там 14 октября все показывает? Смотри.\\nON (123):  Дату. Непонятно почему.\\nDG (124):  Неправильно парсит дату.\\nDG (125):  А, видите?\\nDG (126):  Видимо, да.\\nON (127):  Ну да, по идее, вот здесь было бы хорошо видеть вот эти вот штучки, наверное, а не всё подряд.\\nON (128):  То есть состыковка получается, что здесь какие-то одни ссылки, а здесь вообще все встречи, которые про это, да?\\nDG (129):  Ну, не то чтобы прямо про это, просто вот отсортирован там же, ну, понятно, в общем, здесь неважно, технически и так далее.\\nON (130):  но в принципе по смыслу то он то он как бы нормально выдал да почему декабрь или январь или это вообще какой-то старый непонятно Декабрь или январь, или это может быть...\\nDG (131):  А, вот смотри, обсуждение возможностей запуска рекламы...\\nDG (132):  Ну вот, видишь, он тогда неправильно\\nON (133):  взял, он забрал про другую встречу, вообще про другое, а относ это типа, что это будет про Вексу, хотя это вообще про Вексу.\\nDG (134):  интересно конечно этот фильтр по участникам в там встречи и и да он конечно порешает эту проблему ну да ну и либо какое-то\\nON (135):  тегирование самих встреч может быть ну то есть Ну, то есть сейчас, конечно, очень не хватает возможности раскидать по папкам.\\nON (136):  Потому что у меня там встреча тех просто тьма тьмущая.\\nON (137):  И если бы я могла определенные встречи собирать сразу же в отдельной папке, мне было бы очень удобно.\\nON (138):  Я выгружаю все время транскрипты и использую их дальше в этом, в коде, в проектах.\\nON (139):  Но я в век сейчас вообще не промчу, потому что...\\nON (140):  Потому что в исходе очень удобна эта история с проектами.\\nON (141):  Но выглядит, конечно, это классно.\\nON (142):  Мне интерфейс прям очень нравится.\\nnan (143):  Красивенько.\\nDG (144):  Ну, получилось, что, видишь, я это с нуля снял.\\nDG (145):  С нуля сам все сделал и фронт-энд тоже.\\nDG (146):  Ну, круто.\\nON (147):  Да, вообще круто.\\nDG (148):  Даже получилось, что дизайн тот, который разрабатывал.\\nDG (149):  а то Алексей тоже не пригодился.\\nON (150):  Понятно.\\nDG (151):  Мне просто понравилась тема черно-белая, я в ней продолжу.\\nDG (152):  Ага.\\nON (153):  Ну, у него же...\\nON (154):  Ну, мне кажется, у него было что-то похожее.\\nON (155):  Хотя у него там еще вот этот фон красивенький.\\nON (156):  У него и по колоночкам, да, было.\\nON (157):  Ну, так вы Ну, так выглядит, мне кажется, очень-очень классно.\\nDG (158):  Сыровато, да, немножко получается?\\nON (159):  Повыдача? Ну да.\\nON (160):  Мне кажется, это норм. Надо тестить дальше.\\nON (161):  А что вообще, какие у тебя планы дальше делать?\\nDG (162):  Сдача. Вот я вот это хочу выкатить и докрутить, пока это не будет полезно с пользователями.\\nDG (163):  Потом маркетингом опять.\\nDG (164):  маркетингом опять займусь. Можно, не знаю, можно протехан повторить, можно, наверное, пойти каким-нибудь там, напрашиваться на интервью, что-нибудь такое.\\nON (165):  Ну, я, кстати, узнала в итоге про фичерс на Product Hunt, я выяснила, в чем ручка. Там, короче, это история с тем, что они...\\nON (166):  С тем, что они фичерят, об этом узнаешь заранее, то есть они за день на самом деле все-таки фичерят.\\nON (167):  Ты можешь посмотреть это у себя же на странице, они тебя зафичерили или нет.\\nON (168):  И если они тебя не зафичерили, то...\\nON (169):  то, типа, ты можешь откладывать и писать им бесконечно в поддержку до тех пор, пока они тебя не зафичат.\\nON (170):  Вот.\\nON (171):  Интересная история. Да, Product Hunt, в принципе, можно повторить.\\nON (172):  Мне кажется, что сейчас, если вот еще с этим полезным знанием про фичи и количеством еще контактов, которые накапали, можно было бы снова сделать.\\nON (173):  снова сделать. Но мне, честно говоря, как бы мне кажется, что надо в оплату уходить, потому что все вот эти маркетинговые усилия без приема платежей, это, ну, как бы...\\nON (174):  Ну, как бы мы не тех привлекать бесконечно.\\nON (175):  Надо постараться все-таки подключить какую-нибудь, пускай совсем кривую, косую, но оплату и...\\nON (176):  И пробовать продавать.\\nON (177):  Я сейчас думала про то, чтобы, может быть, брать какие-то совсем небольшие задачи.\\nON (178):  Небольшие задачи по времени, но чтобы эффект был по, как бы, не знаю, может быть, затложенный, но или какой-то значительный, вот, можно попробовать статистику.\\nON (179):  статьи закидывать сейчас после продакт-ханта покернул написать и может быть в русскоязычные еще какие-то написать тоже статьи вот и на апсум На апсуму тоже, мне кажется, что если мы докрутим оплату, то можно податься на апсуму.\\nON (180):  И вот это было бы уже очень хорошо, чтобы был какой-то трекшн по такой.\\nON (181):  А что дальше ты думаешь про инвестиции, не инвестиции?\\nON (182):  Или ты не хочешь брать пока у нас?\\nDG (183):  Ну, я хочу, ну, как бы надо добежать до Майлстоуна, А сколько сейчас, кстати, пользователей?\\nDG (184):  Ну, там примерно столько же, если по...\\nDG (185):  16-17 активных пользователей. Это те, кто на этой неделе не менее трех стричь записывали.\\nDG (186):  Ну, нет, подросло чуть-чуть.\\nDG (187):  Да, чуть-чуть подросло, они откуда-то продолжают прилетать, и есть пользователи, которые постоянно пользуются, которых я дарю.\\nDG (188):  которых я даже не знаю кто это. И они, видимо, не очень хотят, чтобы я знал, кто они.\\nON (189):  Интересно. А по меткам ты не видишь, откуда они переходят?\\nDG (190):  Нет, не вижу, там, наверное, какую-то метку, которую я не цепляю, там, реф, может быть, надо, не все, в общем, я вижу.\\nDG (191):  Не вижу. Ну, в общем, короче говоря, идут пользователи, я не понимаю.\\nON (192):  Русскоговорящие или англоговорящие?\\nON (193):  Ну, давай посмотрим сейчас.\\nDG (194):  Вот, так что я надеюсь, что буду крутить, опубликовать.\\nDG (195):  Вот, в принципе, сейчас уже на презентации.\\nDG (196):  Уже она прям, можно сказать, продакшн уже. Я сегодня допинал до того, что она уже сама работает и не падает.\\nDG (197):  Вот, ну, думаю, надо ее выкатывать или пока еще рано, еще пока докрутить.\\nDG (198):  Вот ту, которую ты сейчас показывал?\\nON (199):  Угу.\\nDG (200):  Конечно, это в любом случае лучше, чем тот дешборд, который есть.\\nDG (201):  С другой стороны, люди к тому привыкли, что пользуются, они знают, что от него ожидать.\\nDG (202):  Но я там сделал кнопку на старое дождевое.\\nON (203):  Не, мне кажется, стоит выкатить просто хотя бы потому, что там уже есть нормальные названия.\\nON (204):  Вроде как мелочь, но в ежедневном использовании это вообще не мелочь.\\nDG (205):  Вот у нас есть какой-то Акамфи, такая компания, что там, в оптришнике.\\nDG (206):  трешники записал на этой неделе 10 встреч захаров вот кто то еще там кто-то еще темно пульса какой-то какие-то бразильцы У Захарова подключилась тоже сети-драйва Калека.\\nDG (207):  О, прикольно. То есть он стал о нас рассказывать.\\nDG (208):  рассказывать да в твоем они сидят на звонках тоже сегодня вот ахмед пользуется Пользуются постоянно.\\nDG (209):  Из новых, кажется, Бразилия все-таки продолжает идти, Бразилия.\\nDG (210):  Идти Бразилия. И снова продолжается Бразилия.\\nON (211):  Ага, хорошо. Бразилия и снова.\\nON (212):  бразилия из новых по одному аккаунту или есть компании потому что я же там коннектилась типа с фаундерами и своего аккаунта\\nDG (213):  своего есть какие-то компании вот такая основная идея этого идея этого глобального чата в том что ты за том что ты объединяешь эти базы и можешь чат от вас в чат не только со своими звонками.\\nON (214):  Да, вот это вот мне прямо очень понравилось, когда первый раз я тестила, и у меня выдача там была такая релевантная еще.\\nON (215):  релевантные еще например потому что вылетали какие-то встречи твои с экспертами и туда подгружалась как бы вся информация там что-то я спрашивала про всякие маркетинговые стратегии еще что-то такое и вот тут вот прям был И вот тут вот прям было интересно, полезно, то есть как бы к встречам я доступа не имею, но как база знаний, по которой ты можешь пройтись и посмотреть, а про что.\\nON (216):  а про что там вообще мы с кем разговаривали, вот это очень круто получается.\\nDG (217):  Ну да, у меня как раз такая идея была, чтобы сделать два типа уровня доступа.\\nDG (218):  Один для того, чтобы мы...\\nDG (219):  Для того, чтобы можно было посмотреть, скопировать транскрипт, а другой, когда у тебя эта информация вылетает в чате, агрегируется, на доступа ко встречам нет.\\nDG (220):  Пока встречи нет.\\nON (221):  Ну, нормально, мне кажется, вполне.\\nON (222):  Там даже, наверное, транскрипт особо и не нужен в таких ситуациях.\\nON (223):  в ситуациях с клиентами, там, если это КАЗД, ну, тоже, наверное, если, ну, тут, видишь, как бы, надо знать, что спросить.\\nON (224):  Это, мне кажется, ключевое ограничение вообще.\\nON (225):  вообще все все это история что тебе надо четко понимать что ты хочешь узнать но\\nDG (226):  можно запустить какой-то салфетки Это когда по какому-то алгоритму индексируется индекс, скажем так, поэтому индексу проходит паук и паук и спрашивает сначала там условно, кто там основные действующие, или там какие-то три ключевых проекта, что-нибудь такое.\\nnan (227):  Вот. Потом\\nDG (228):  Потом в каждый проект, потом проект А, спрашиваю, отчет по проекту А, или там три ключевых составляющих проекта А.\\nDG (229):  проекта А, внутри ключевых состоящих проектов Б.\\nDG (230):  И так вот он строит такое дерево знаний, вот разбирает его.\\nDG (231):  Во-первых, это дерево можно отдельно, ну, по-прежнему, Ну, опубликовать их на уши, сделать из этого базу знаний, к которой можно ходить.\\nDG (232):  Во-вторых, из этого можно сделать подсказки.\\nON (233):  Ну да, это было бы интересно.\\nDG (234):  Ну или, кстати, можно просто случайный субсед взять, то есть просто...\\nDG (235):  Просто дать какой-то случайный массив информации и по нему сгенерировать подсказки.\\nDG (236):  Для подсказок это будет самый простой вариант.\\nON (237):  Ну, звучит-то классно, надо посмотреть, как это будет, наверное, в реальности выглядеть, то есть, что он будет выдавать, насколько это будет реально релевантно.\\nON (238):  И это все получается...\\nON (239):  То есть сейчас мы уходим как бы от использования реалтайма, от реалтайма, наоборот, в дашборд больше?\\nDG (240):  Ну, я не вижу...\\nDG (241):  Не вижу причин, почему надо прям уходить из риэлта.\\nDG (242):  Я думаю, что наоборот, можно этот поиск дергать, например, из риэлта.\\nDG (243):  Например, кто-то упоминает компанию, мы на нее нажимаем, и этот запрос идет через глобальный поиск и возвращает информацию, что мы знаем об этой компании.\\nDG (244):  Вот, то есть здесь синергия какая-то есть с real-time.\\nON (245):  Да. А что у пользователей сейчас вообще происходит? Они...\\nON (246):  Они как бы что-то щелкают внутри или нет?\\nON (247):  Ты смотрел, как кто себя вот сейчас ведет?\\nDG (248):  Слушай, я вот...\\nDG (249):  Несколько недель полностью в этой разработке, очень много всего, только на вот саммит немножко отвлекся.\\nDG (250):  отвлекся от исходил на сайт на сайт ивент полезно ну ну да уж знаешь что Прошу.\\nON (251):  Да, прикольно.\\nDG (252):  Заводская тусовка.\\nDG (253):  Вот так.\\nDG (254):  Ну, в общем, что-то я себе записал.\\nDG (255):  записалась то что ты мне фига сдаешь что-то с датами у нас с датами помочь хорошо можешь еще раз посмотреть как он индексация послан\\nON (256):  да все равно целых 611 тысяч 1100 еще в очереди на инвестицию так еще Я же... А, подожди, надо, наверное, новый чатик сделать, да?\\nDG (257):  Ну, хотя бы эта кнопочка понятна.\\nnan (258):  Какая?\\nDG (259):  Ну, много чат.\\nON (260):  А вот, кстати, куда она делась?\\nDG (261):  Ну, она тебе сейчас не нужна?\\nDG (262):  А, кстати, она не нужна.\\nDG (263):  А, вот у нас новый вирус.\\nON (264):  Ага, ну ладно, так.\\nDG (265):  Вот эти вот старинные встречи, в общем, куда там...\\nON (266):  Да, наверное, это надо как-то...\\nDG (267):  Так, а что у нас проиндексировалось?\\nDG (268):  Давай посмотрим.\\nDG (269):  Back to meetings.\\nDG (270):  А, сейчас.\\nON (271):  Почему везде вот эта дата стоит?\\nON (272):  Какая-то интересная история.\\nON (273):  Или это просто индексация, что ли?\\nDG (274):  Нет, это, я не знаю, неправильно дата отображает.\\nDG (275):  так что-то вроде ничего нечего нового наверное мои мои встречи В основном забили. Надо случайную ротацию сделать, чтобы они там... Надо перемешивать на стечи.\\nDG (276):  чтобы в перемешку они подавались.\\nDG (277):  Ну ладно, в общем, потом когда-нибудь вернешься.\\nDG (278):  Вернешься, посмотришь, что-нибудь.\\nDG (279):  Надо же было бы.\\nON (280):  Ну, видишь, вот у меня как бы в моем workflow, я просто забираю сейчас.\\nON (281):  Я убираю сейчас все транскрипты отовсюду, где я их записываю, и все у меня в Клоде, в проекты, и там как бы под каждый этот, свои транскрипты.\\nON (282):  Это, конечно, прям очень удобно.\\nON (283):  А чтобы это сюда перенести, это мне надо...\\nON (284):  Я не знаю, что надо.\\nDG (285):  Тебе ничего не надо делать.\\nDG (286):  Просто Global Search...\\nON (287):  использовать по идее но у нее от вот смотри мне надо четко выбирать как что и какое я хочу чтобы информация как у тебя ну вот как в коде тоже там что-то Что-то добавляешь как knowledge base, а что-то у тебя остается в каждом чатике.\\nON (288):  Вот этот момент, что ты как бы регулируешь, что у тебя базовая информация, что ты каждый раз забираешь,\\nDG (289):  Ну, здесь просто, да, надо будет кнопку там сделать make private, например, или archive.\\nDG (290):  Две кнопки. Одна кнопка, которая, чтобы не шарить ни с кем, а другая кнопка, чтобы убрать из индексации.\\nON (291):  Да, и вот смотри, и все равно...\\nON (292):  Но нужно добавление материала, то есть я не знаю, сколько у нас сейчас в Векси окно, сколько ты можешь туда закинуть информации в чатик, расскажу для чего.\\nON (293):  чего, у тебя прошла какая-то встреча, дальше ты можешь уйти в почту или там в чатике и с этим человеком продолжать общаться.\\nON (294):  И там, если я продолжаю общаться, я закидываю в один в один чат всю информацию из почты, из чатов.\\nON (295):  И мне удобно, что у меня под одного человека один чат, где вся информация, и я быстренько пишу все, что мне надо.\\nON (296):  Вот.\\nON (297):  То есть у тебя получается полная коммуникация.\\nDG (298):  Я хочу решать эту проблему путем добавления...\\nDG (299):  других сущностей не только звонок ну и там email или просто заметка вот начинать начиная с заметки то есть ты просто берешь текстовую заметку туда кидаешь что кидаешь что угодно, и он...\\nDG (300):  В тот же индекс разбирает это все.\\nDG (301):  Там эти люди упоминаются, они тоже попадают в этот индекс.\\nON (302):  Ну да, но это в принципе не важно, что там.\\nON (303):  Главное, чтобы ты мог заблокировать.\\nDG (304):  ты мог загрузить эту всю информацию да ну то есть будет для начала это будет\\nON (305):  просто купить ну это нормально сейчас часто тоже это копипаст просто в просто даже больше копипасты потому что тебе надо еще транскрипт выгрузить и вести а так у тебя это будет автоматически подгружаться но и вот да то Да, то есть у тебя должна ветка с одним человеком как бы быть, наверное, единая.\\nON (306):  Тогда это получается прям удобно.\\nON (307):  Да, по людям, наверное, я бы это сортировала.\\nON (308):  первоначально по людям, потом по проектам еще. Интересно, интересно.\\nDG (309):  интересно. Окей, ну ладно, в общем, пользуюсь, скажешь мне, скажешь. Хорошо, ладно. Я тебе тогда закину...\\nON (310):  вот эти вот там инструменты, которые были для платежей, попробую все-таки их подключить и подумаю тогда, я еще хотел созвониться, чтобы понять, как мы сейчас...\\nON (311):  Типа, как мы сейчас позиционируемся?\\nON (312):  Что ты дальше делаешь по разработке?\\nON (313):  И как мы пробуем про себя рассказывать?\\nDG (314):  Ну, у меня позиционирование...\\nDG (315):  Традиционирование – это то, что ВЕКСа слушает звонок, транскрибирует, дает полезную информацию и собирает из этого знания, которые доступны.\\nDG (316):  которые доступны во время звонка и после звонка, для всей команды, со всех встреч в команде.\\nDG (317):  То есть речь идет о том, чтобы собирать и выбирать и давать доступ к знаниям.\\nDG (318):  Все-таки к этому.\\nDG (319):  Мне кажется, это все равно некий какой-то конечная точка.\\nDG (320):  точка который который идет этот это направление развития продукта любого то есть одно дело делать самый и там отчеты рассылать его всем это это наверное полезно но вообще наверное идея но вообще наверное Именно информация в широком смысле и доступ к ней, к знаниям, это то, ради чего все это стоит делать.\\nON (321):  все это стоит делать вообще ну я вот у меня там какой-то один из последних разговоров тоже по векси с b2b продавцом овцом был про то что типа как бы нам надо нам нельзя заводить вот через это людей продукт потому что это очень сложно это сложно объяснить это сложно попробовать это точно не для всех для всех и кажется что все таки надо позиционироваться вначале вот на каких-то таких очень простых вещах ну вот мне сейчас прям очевидны какие-то преимущества простого использования использование, нет ограничений этих встреч, ну, про которые мы как бы и так уже много раз как бы говорили, но, наверное, надо про них продолжать говорить и заводить через это.\\nON (322):  А уже потом, когда человек как бы как бы чуть-чуть втянулся и накопил какую-то базу встреч рассказывать ему про вот эти вот сложные штуки типа что а что еще ты можешь сделать здесь\\nDG (323):  интересно в любом случае люди это делают для чего-то для того чтобы сохранить информацию иметь к ней доступ для того чтобы записать встречу Fear of missing out, да, то есть здесь fear of missing out, это все говорят одно и то же, зачем я это делаю? Я это делаю, потому что я знаю, что мне спокойнее так, что у меня это будет сохранено.\\nDG (324):  А что значит было сохранено? Потом у тебя возникает проблема в том, что у тебя нет к этому доступа, потому что ты не можешь ничего найти.\\nDG (325):  Найти это окей, можно реализовать путем просто фильтрации поиска по спикеру, по участнику встречи и там копаться, но это...\\nDG (326):  Это найти, кто что сказал, да, это окей.\\nDG (327):  Да, здесь речь идет о том, чтобы...\\nDG (328):  получить ассистента, который по твоим знаниям функционирует.\\nDG (329):  В этом же смысл вообще чат GPT, в том, чтобы получить доступные знания.\\nDG (330):  главным такие базовые глобальные знания вот эта штука хочет сделать не глобальном не по глобальным знаниям а по локальным каким-то закрытым твоим знаниям, по знаниям компании. Это больше в любом случае, это более ценные знания, потому что они не какие-то общественные, общественные базы, а твои те, которые действительно для тебя важны. Мне кажется,\\nON (331):  что здесь есть еще знаешь промежуточное звено, типа вот у тебя в начале это Вначале этот fear of missing out, а потом у тебя как бы, ну вот, не знаю, для меня как ключевая штука, почему я все это делаю, потому что это очень сильно ускоряет процессы.\\nON (332):  то есть если я не пишу встречу то я должна потом там что-то из головы вспоминать придумывать или еще что то если я пишу встречу то я за пять минут напишу флаг и и еще там что то то есть что-то то есть как бы вот этот вот эта штука про то что ты ускоряешься причем очень сильно ускоряешься но мы не должны пропускать этот момент а я А я думаю, что он для многих прям ключевой.\\nON (333):  И тут очень хорошее ЛТП, как бы, про то, что ты экономишь по два часа в день или сколько там, ну, не знаю, можно придумать.\\nnan (334):  А потом уже у тебя вот эта глобальная задача аналитической базы знаний, когда ты что-то копишь и анализируешь, и возвращаешься к этому.\\nnan (335):  к этому потому что ну наверное по многим встречам ты никак не возвращаешься ты\\nnan (336):  просто сделал задачу после встречи все и как бы тебе больше ничего не надо\\nnan (337):  Окей, ладно, давай потестируешь.\\nnan (338):  Хорошо, попробуем посмотреть.\\n'"
