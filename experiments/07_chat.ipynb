So we've chased in and bricked, we've chased in a new line for the wall to put electricity in.  My husband's an electrical engineer, he can run cables and stuff yeah and so i've done the plumbing and i've been doing plastering and getting ready to paint so there you go i put in a new ceiling so it's busy but yeah we've been I've been renovating this house for 20 years and it still looks like crap.  It's a long time.  Why, why, why so long?  Because we're, like, had kids and...  Yeah.  ...money and...  Like, you know what I mean?  It's just like, you wouldn't believe how much it costs to hire somebody to do like the most basic task.  So we just go, we can do it ourselves and then it doesn't get done, right?  And indirectly, you end up spending more money on doing it yourself than you would have.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Yeah, yeah.  Well, I stayed at home raising the kids for a few years too, so that's right.  just threw things back and all of that.  Like, I mean, I had my own business, but like I wasn't making a ton of money.

       "  > Marcus Torrisi:  good because they give you an understanding of how everything works but you know their data migration I talk about okay so you've got a contact list so you need to import it this is how you fix it and this how you import it but when you do an actual migration it is a pain in the ass so this would give you a good idea but then yes you'll eventually have a situation where you do need it import like multi-object like the multi-object ones are really hard not hard but like that complex, you've got to get them right, like the first time.  Otherwise, yeah, we've, I've had, I've had things where, uh, they weren't sinking.  And so they were getting skipped and there were errors and you have like limits.  they have to throttle it yeah yeah so I'm gonna watch that but you know that the things that I've done in the past were were multi-object but I was also with the data team and we had a custom API key and like you know they were handling sort of the push yes and I was handling the mapping and the projecting of you know so awesome So anyway, it'll be, I think it'll be a good one and it'll help me, you know, I think it's also one that's like, if you can understand that, then you can pretty much understand the platform.  Right.  So.  Agreed.  Yeah.  yeah there's a few more i thought that were good but like they'll take the time uh and i also signed up for the boot camp boot camp are you gonna do what you think well i do  I looked at your link that you sent, but they're at 2 and 3 a.m., and then it didn't say anything about recordings.  No, you got to go.  Once a week for six weeks at 3 a.m.  I am going to bitch the entire time that they need a Southern Hemisphere version, or they need like two time zone versions, you know, that I can maybe choose a late night version versus a 3 a.m. version.  And they shouldn't all be based out of U.S. time.  No, no.  Hello, kitty.  My cat's looking very hot.  So did you hear from Yorder?  I heard from Yorder.  Their book, they literally just emailed about 10 minutes ago um we're gonna do 10 a.m on thursday okay cool so you'll message me okay yep I'll create the event for that.  But yes, I think good, um, good idea there, like to, you know, to walk through, we're going to walk through that on Thursday, obviously, but I think, yeah, one of the key things is obviously it's a simple.  buy it as much as possible oh you've already done that awesome yeah sweet i've created that  i probably simplified even more but like i feel like these are a lot smaller um i'll fix that one that was the one i needed to go back for this one here is what I wanted to finish up but for the rest of them they're a lot shorter now yeah that's awesome yeah  cool  I mean they're  probably still  long in your opinion but it's not  Like it's not about, um, if you can, if you can talk about them in a more succinct way, because what we obviously do is we obviously share this with the client, so like if they want to go back and, and.  So you do share this document?  With clients that I think are not going to steal it.  Uh-huh.  Which, so, like, I don't, well, yes.  I don't like to share it because like I said, and like I say, you might have heard me on the call with Yabba. I was like, I'll share this with you, but just keeping in mind that this takes a lot of work and it's not really it's not really expected to be shared with anyone else.  And that's what I try to include on the email as well.  But there was this one client that basically said to me after we did an audit, probably about six months ago, but he was like, oh, look, you know, you, you guys are quite expensive and I can just get an offshore team to do all these things for me.  And that's what I feel like this is like a technical SEO audit.  If somebody gave this to me for free, I could just have my team run it.  Yeah, that's fine.\n",

They explore the effectiveness of Google Docs versus Slack for tracking questions and answers, the importance of understanding HubSpot's lead object, and the need for better organization in their work processes.\n",
       "  > Dianna Lloyd:  Um, let me think about that. I think you could set up like a notification or something like that. But, but I just the idea, it doesn't have to necessarily be a Google Doc. But I mean, as soon as you tag somebody off.  Obviously, that works.  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  But let me just have a look and see if I can find it.  We can talk through it and see if there's a solution that works for us, because I was just thinking, you know, this is going to get bigger than just you managing, right?  And so you're going to need to see what I do and what, and I think just looking at my tasks is not always going to show you what the questions have been and what has worked on yeah you know and i and i think i think it's probably a good idea i've never had to work with a document like that other than with the hubspot csm yeah but it was good it was really good i found it good i found it helpful i was always using it we were back and forth in the con you know and she would go out and get answers and come back to it when she wanted you know what i mean but it was like this little bulletin board for the two of us like a slack channel i guess in a way but slack doesn't hold on to data long and that's the problem with slack is your your account i think clears after 90 days you lose you lose information nation no not not not ours for me it said it it only holds 90 days of history  does it still say that now because it Shouldn't, because I'm paying for you as a user.  It said that to me before.  I'll check.  So are you sure you're...  Yeah, I've got all...  All time?  Yeah.  I've got all my yeah all time. Yep. Okay, I got a message that mine was 90 days  So I'll just double check that that was a couple of days ago. I thought that was last week. I Was looking for something and it said 90 days maybe it's a setting you've got for me no it's that i need to upgrade  no you're a regular member so you're you're a paying member That shouldn't be the case, but...  Oh, look, okay.  Yeah.  But it's probably not the best way of keeping your history of everything anyway.  Yeah.  No, yeah, because everything is – yeah, I'm paying for it, so it should be there.  Oh, one – one – I mean, we could –  That one is something like this in Slack, but they have to be on Slack.  And I think Google's might be better because yeah, there's like channel and all of that and Slack, you're going to get all over the place.  And it's nice to have like just like I've got one client you know what i mean yes yeah so um okay and then i've got a 430 and then um We can talk about.  I've gone through it, but like at some point I'd like to love to have a coffee and just sit down and like, or a beer or something like that and have a chat about some thoughts I did.  Like I said, last week.  spent a lot of time learning about the the lead object um and how it might be used and i think i have a much better understanding of using it moving forward i think it's not I think it's something that people are kind of ignoring.  But I think HubSpot are going to be pushing that it gets used.  Yeah.  Well, it's relatively new information.  Yeah, it's new. It's been the last six months, I think, or a year.  It's only, like, it came out, I think, like, April or May this year, so...  Anyway, I went through a couple of videos and watched and I got like, you know that one of them was really talking, I grabbed this from one of the videos and I was like, Oh, this is really cool.  And it was, you know, talking about the different life cycle stages and how they saw it mapping and how they work together.  Yeah.  And so I thought that was a useful...  way of to help somebody understand how these different things work together because i'm sure that clients probably really don't understand that no they don't  I find it hard.  I actually think that they, and then you've got like this life cycle stages, and then you've got contact life cycle stage, and then company life cycle stage, which I'm assuming they'd have to be absolutely  completely married yeah they're synced yeah so they're synced on the back end so  okay anyway that's in there so whenever you want to go look at it um So, yeah, so still doing the HubSpot Academy stuff.  If you have anything that you would like me to do, I've started with this one.  Yeah, awesome.  Love it.  It's a big, chunky one.  Yeah.  That's a good one, yeah.  Have you done it?  I think I've done it at a previous – when I was working for a first job.  Pretty sure I did the certification, yeah.  Okay.  done it in real life yeah same yeah and this is the thing it's like the certifications are really\n",

Okay.  the cleaning that's the only they're the only ones i saw that okay okay yeah and then there's like binnacle training or binnacle but we don't really use it i just email and call the guy that we work with.  Okay.  Do you have a document then that you work with out of with a client that is always like a spreadsheet with like lots of tabs and it might have a place where they can put questions or are you just operating out of emails?  You're usually just operating out of emails And then based, and then based on the task, I would just create the task.  In ClickUp.  In ClickUp, like ClickUp's my source of truth for things that we're doing.  Okay.  So one of the things that was a.  really good tool that and i'll try to find i did save a copy of dives version of it but die walsh uh and i think this is something that hubspot does she has a spreadsheet right and i don't know if you've ever worked with the CSM, but what she does to manage that client relationship, which I thought was a really good tool, she has this spreadsheet that she shared There's between the two of us, right, a Google Sheet.  And it has one of the tabs is basically question, answer, comment kind of thing, right?  So, and it keeps like this living history between everybody can go on there and add things.  And then she has like, we had our weekly cadence or our monthly cadence or whatever it was.  her to have time to go and find the answer.  And it was like, is it urgent?  Is it, you know, it was a really nice tool that you could have with clients that I think gives them a place that they're thinking of something they can  pop it but they don't have to necessarily bug you okay so then how i i i've i've done not done something but i've been involved in something similar like that before i'm pretty sure it was with HubSpot how do how does the CSN know or the person receiving the question know that there's a new you can comment well you'll get a new task\n",

       "  > Dianna Lloyd:  Yeah, I'm using one for network code. It's a free one. And it's really limited. It's very limited. And I'm, I'm shopping right now for another customer of mine. And I've told her build her her website on the c3 crm because she has she's a startup and i just think it's the best way of starting as a free like even if she doesn't use hubspot i still think it's worthwhile. If you just need to have some landing pages and you need to have a presence in some forms, it's free. Like I don't see the drawback for it.  Yeah. So that's what I'm doing. Yeah. So that's what, that's what we're in the  it of it now but in regards to like logging emails looking at meetings that are against contact records or deals or companies that should all be there with your level of access i'll have a look  can make sure it's all working right so that you know because i have like meetings set up and emails back and forth i'll just double check now that i can see i'll just double check that everything's mapping correctly and all of that um  So I can see, like, everything with, like, Samantha this afternoon is tracking in there.  Okay.  Yeah, which is good.  Okay.  Cool.  Alright, so that's your plan for me. That was my question. What's the plan for me?  So I'm meeting with I think I'm not meeting with Samantha today.  I think the only one that's interested is Shannon.  So it must be Shannon.  Samantha doesn't give a poop.  Yeah, sure.  So yeah, fine, whatever.  I'll talk to her and see what She wants, and she can be the middleman for passing on the ideas.  I can really pass on the ideas, right?  Like, no, no, that's right.  Exactly.  Right.  And that's all you need to do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And just say like, you know, based on my experience this is what i thought would work yeah yeah exactly and if they don't if they don't take it on will you you go well here's your here's your workflow is your workflow here's  your email is it ready to go you want me to turn it on all right okay  yeah so don't yeah don't don't stress about it too much if they don't take i'm sure she'll take on the feedback because you've got good ideas but like if she goes nah we want to do this you just have to go yeah all right we'll just do what you want  You'll see in the document or the e-mail I shared with you, probably had a link to the Taurus sales contact form journey.  Yeah.  You may or may not be interested in using this is sort of sort of document or if you have something that's different that you want to use with clients to sort of walk them through a workflow and this is actually two workflows in this document because it helps better explain.  This is what I'm gonna walk her through when we go through it.  Like I said, you come in by this, then there's the next one.  And this is the experience, right?  So, and then we can, just walk through it quite easy and then she can you know i've got the original brief in there um  and then was this the one was this the one that it was like left to right like showing the flow of the of the workflow, is that the one that you want me to talk about?  No, I'll share my screen.  It's just a spreadsheet.  It's just a very basic document is to like kind of track what has been done and then just to walk them through it.  So like once we start building something, they can see and you can walk them through it.  This is what the customer experience is, right?  So especially when it comes to a market.  getting and you know maybe even sequences we could add in there you know and just say this is their experience to the whole thing because I think that's what happens with these people is a lot of times is they just don't see the end entire picture of the customer journey in that one thing.  And this is the version so that we could always use this document going back between the two groups.  Just saying, this is what we did.  I have to make a version two, you know, so I've got next step suggestions and things like that.  They can use this to talk to their team about what was done.  Yeah.\n",

So this is similar to something I've done in the passed just to make sure that it was very easy to see all workflows and how they tied together um yeah you might have seen sequences can be added to campaigns now which which is pretty That is cool, yeah, awesome.  What would be good is that, it would be good to link this document in side of the task um in click up yeah just so that like when we go because like you know like both of us will be in the next couple months or coming to next year There's going to be things flying everywhere.  What I usually do most of the time, if I'm sending a document to the client, I will have or pop it in the comment side on the right-hand side.  That way it's all there and all in one spot.  I think I, is that me?  Is that it?  Yeah, I did already.  Oh, okay, sweet.  Oh, there you go.  Awesome.  One step ahead.  One step ahead.  Okay.  Sweet.  Yeah, I like it.  If you want, I can build out a template if you want to use it and edit it or whatever.  Yeah, that would be good. Yeah.  Or you can make the template.  I don't have admin rights.  our workspace so you'll have to do that another thing  after  give me  admin rights  to the  workspace  can you  tell can  you tell I've ran this for a year and a half my on my own this is why you need to let go of some of the things if you want  give me admin rights oh yeah no no i know no i know i'm more than happy to do that but i'm like  i've never had to do it so i'm like i know it's okay it's okay  Still don't see the drive anyway.  So I know that you're working on that and Christmas, but, um, cause it's not going to be good long-term for me to be operating in my own personal drive with folders for clients.  Yes.  I agree.  So but that's where I'm at right now because I don't see it when I go to drive.  I'll just share with this with you.  This is what I see.  So if I see.  workspaces i don't have any workspaces i just have my drive which i've started creating folders um which is not ideal obviously and then um I don't have any folders shared with me except for one.  Okay.  I've just created a workspace.  Okay, cool.  Yeah.  If you refresh that, is that...  Show for you  your workspace  That's a add  i don't know we can deal with this another day like it's not a it's not a today thing but just letting you know i'll keep it in my my update please Yes, please.

Yeah, no, no, it's still on, but it's not on that stuff.  That's the thing.  It's more about, more focused on the client side rather than that branding stuff, yeah.  It's like, it's on next year.  So I can see that I have, what kind of access do I have?  You've just got a core seat.  Okay.  So you don't like you have.  But HubSpot's really given me the shits because we had to actually buy HubSpot sort of now released a new update for partners.  Partners have to spend $600 US a month on their subscription.  So why did you get content?  and not another sales seat and something else and more contacts or something okay so contacts i  okay so the reason why i didn't get more sales seat you have to have a minimum of four sales seats okay so i was like well i'm really we're going to be using like one and a half of those like i mean if you had a sales seat we can get you a sales seat when it comes time like if you're going to be doing more sales but i was like i'm not going to waste money on potentially three seats that we won't be using no i would probably be using it more like  not that I'm going through like a sales pipeline process right but more of maybe is it a service level or something like that like I want to be able to record what I'm doing and then like have meetings and email people and follow up with them and go through like you know go use the if we're going to use the tools like use the tools like the the playlists or not playlists but the uh Playbooks and stuff like that, you know for like the Sessions where I'm like, okay, let's walk through this and like make sure I ask the right questions You know, I mean blah blah blah and we capture the right details every single time times so that when we go back, if we have to hand over to each other, we've got all that information there, right?  Yes.  Yes.  So like playbooks, in that case, would be the only thing that you would need access to.\n",

       "  > Dianna Lloyd:  What do you think about the new thing with being able to archive properties even if they're in use of something so like no meaning like what do you think about cleaning up people's portals and like just cleaning out a whole bunch of properties that they don't use and just oh yeah 100 is that what you do for for clients do you go in and you just go you're not using Like, 60% of your contact properties.  It wouldn't be something that we would do initially unless that was what we were tasked to do.  That would be like we finished...  Like, say we had an existing account.  Let's say, like, Next Mile.  Like, if Next Mile were, like, kind of draining the amount of work that we needed to do, it would be, like, we kind of try and do, like, sort of a quarterly like review and like what kind of workshop with our clients to go okay these are the things that you want to do in the next three months if that conversation is kind of like dead That's when we would go, okay, properties, let's clean them up and let's consolidate.  Let's fix your views up.  Let's do all these things.  It's like one of my clients, Hunter Gather, who are the buyers agents and the property  guys they have like a bunch of workflows like every account that are kind of like stagnant and maybe be deleted so that's what we're doing over the christmas period to make sure we use the hours is doing that  validation piece okay and when you're tracking hours for these guys let's say you have um taurus and you've got i don't know how many hours you have with taurus  yeah it should it should say on the top so if you go in if you're going to click up you're going to share your screen it might be yeah yep  of 21 hours and 20 uh what else is four hours i can't oh my god if you go to  Now, if you go to the list on the left-hand side, so yeah, but yeah, that one.  So if you click on that, Oh, my God.  What is with this?  Do you have...  You have, well, ClickUp's integrated.  See, I have that as well, but I've got the timer.  So if I share my screen, this is so frustrating.  So see this.  I can see here.  I don't see all that.  why like this i don't know why but it's integrated with clicker it's all there it's active maybe going to configure maybe it's everybody Now the config is like the only  Members  Oh, wow. How'd you do that?  I don't know. What? What today?  If you do 20, if you just do 20, it logs in as hours.  I did, I did 20 minutes.  Yeah.  So if you have that, I've been called out so many times, but if you do that, yeah, it, it defaults to.  to hours no i'm done for the month yeah thanks for your help we'll chat next year  um yeah let me have a um just get back  me on that you don't have to it's not it's not something i have to have today i'll put it in my little list of questions of like please how do i track but you should be able to see that i don't  know what the setting is  How do I keep abreast of the client hours?  Like, for instance, there will be...  Taurus would be a very good example of I'm doing some things for Taurus and you're doing some things for Taurus and we don't over promise on either end that we'll eat into the hours total for Taurus.  exactly yeah so that's kind of what I'm thinking or it could just be in the meantime we'll just message I'll just message and just say you'll tell me you can't spend more than two hours on them if it's going to be longer than we need to talk to them and say look it'll have to be next month or whatever yeah yeah i don't like  yeah that's fine that's fine with me it's a good i mean if it comes to  Is that right?  So I'll just keep that communication open and I'll just say, look, how many hours have we got left with Taurus?  Can I do this blah, blah, blah for them?  Yeah.  But even like I say, Diana, I'm not a micromanager.  or I'm not, I don't try to be a micromanager.  So if you like to me, like, I really want to do this and it's going to potentially go me.  We're going to go over the hours by one or two.  are really big on value-based pricing so just just because we go over a couple hours it doesn't mean that we don't do it yeah no that's that's fine it was just more of like i don't want  blow out your hours on something when you didn't want to or you've already blown it out somewhere and you're like no no no they've gotten way too much this month and that and  that's where that tracker is going to come in handy so yeah exactly but in the meantime  Until we get that, I'll just make sure I check in with you.  It's not about micromanaging.  It's just making sure that at least you have some estimate of where the hours are being used for different clients, right?  And then when I get my own clients going, I should be able to see that and manage that one myself, right?  Exactly right.  Yep.  Love it.  Because I've got something in about five minutes.  Yes.  okay was there anything quickly that we need to run through  on your list yeah the only other thing  was um did you want to give me some homework are you happy for me to just continue on uh  doing the gap fills no so i'm going to give you a task to do which we've got a and i'll try and say it in 30 seconds or less one of our clients we have a new prospect richard j they're called richard j they do like industrial washing machines industrial like dry cleaning equipment for hospitals and cool businesses like that they're looking Looking to get marketing hub, not sure if there is professional enterprise and they want to integrate that with dynamics.  Okay.  We have a discovery call with them on the 7th of January.  before I'm flying overseas and having some nice sashimi and What else I saw ideas and things like that, right? So What I want you to do it all and I'll share with you some resources sources, we need to do a discovery with them, like a marketing hub discovery to understand their key objectives.  Exactly what they want to do, exactly what they need to see within HubSpot for their side and we need to get a good idea of what questions we need to ask based on um and i'll share with you the initial conversation that we had with them on firefly on fireflies yeah so fireflies we recorded the conversation google fireflies  no no just fireflies  the AI no-taker  oh oh sorry I was thinking about a totally different thing and I was like you're using that that's like getting destroyed or something it was like totally out it's old so we  We obviously need to prepare an agenda for that discovery call, okay?  In which they, yeah, you'll have a listen, but I'll provide like a better brief I can provide you with some questions and everything like that, that we may want to use, but I want to, from your marketing side, I want you to sort of put together a bit of an agenda for that call so that we get the...  objectives and we get the scope of work that we need so that we can put together a quote for them.  Because that could be a really cool project to work on.  So did you say they wanted it to integrate with something?  Okay.  So HubSpot would just be their marketing tool.  They won't use sales or any service or anything like that.  They're just going to use it for their marketing  And then once they have leads and things like that,  push them into Dynamics.  Okay.  So what questions to ask them?  Yeah.  What are their needs?  What are their requirements?  requirements what are their objectives as a business yeah so that we can put together a  scope for them and i'll and i'll send you some a bunch of questions that i got from my account  manager and stuff but it's going to be a pure marketing project so i know you've got\n",

I was jumping around.  So yeah, I'll finish that up.  Yeah.  That's no big deal.  And then...  Yep, talking to them today.  Yep.  Samantha, we've already talked about that.  OLM project, what is OLM?  LLM stand for? Oh, LLM is that other company? Sorry.  Online.  Yeah. Lead management. Yeah.  Yeah.  You included me in the meeting.  and i spat out a few ideas back and forth with you in this thing yes but i didn't know what happened after that like it sounded like they adopted the idea but i wasn't even sure if the idea would work Yeah, well, we went down a different route.  So instead of using the landing page form, what we've used is the meeting link for that particular clinic.  as like the so when someone because what what olm is doing they're just qualifying the lead and then they're booking in for a callback i guess the more like a more qualified call back from the treatment coordinator so so so what what they're what olm is doing is basically calling up the the lead and saying look you know we're from next mile we're blah, blah, blah, you know, I'm going to ask you a few questions.  And then once they, I guess, qualify, they'll say, oh, look, well, what we'll do is we'll book you in for a callback with one of our treatment coordinators.  Just a warm handover.  Say again?  Just a warm handover.  A warm handover.  That's exactly right.  Yeah, okay.  And what we do is we're going to use those meeting links as the trigger for them to be, I guess, removed from OLM having to deal with them.  in all aspects. Okay, so if the meeting link  is known or something like that? Well, it's like  because the contact will be submitting the meeting link, but it's actually the OLM salesperson.  So we on their behalf.  Yeah.  So we it's like, yeah.  So we basically say in the workflow is like for any form submission is the meeting link, because HubSpot understands, okay, the contacts submitted it, but they haven't submitted it, but they have, but they haven't, so then that's we use as the trigger and the work.  It's a HubSpot form, right?  Well, yeah, it's like a, it's like a meeting link form.  Yeah.  Okay.  Sorry.  I'm just, I know that you don't owe me this explanation, but I was trying to understand, so the meeting link.  itself yeah is how is how are they where's the meeting link sit on hubspot no no sorry the customer has called Contacted Smiles.  Yep.  OLM gets the form information somehow to recontact this customer.  So they get sent an email or something?  Correct.  Yes.  Yep.  They get sent an email that says.  Hey, such and such details, because you've personalized the email that goes out and it just sends it to OLM.  OLM says OK, so it goes in their queue.  They get in touch with the person.  The person says, yeah, I'd like somebody to call me back.  What does OLM actually fill out?  The meeting link form.  Where's that sit?  They just get.  Oh, it's just a URL that OLM has, and then they just fill in the details.  Exactly right.  Oh, okay. So a form is created And you can even put in, like, I guess, a hidden field saying created by OLM or something like that.  Well, yeah, that's right.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.  And then...  Off the back of that form submission on the meeting link.  That's what we do with our triggers.  Okay.  So you just created a form in HubSpot and given OLM the URL.\n",

So what I have to say about your SEO, I mean, the main reason I reached out to you as well was, if you have seen your main competitors like Otter or Five Flies, Just I would like to know, do you consider Otter or Firefly as your competitor, or do you have some other competitors that you think are more relevant, if you can name them to me?  Yeah, we've got Otter, Firefly, We've got Fathom, we've got ETLGB, and these are the main competitors.  Okay, so while doing my head  I went on to Fireflies and Autumn.  So if you actually go onto the website and you did a little exploration on the website, you will see that both of them have a specific blog section on your website. And if you actually go a little bit deeper and see what type of content they're actually writing on the website. So that's not just an informational content that they write, their main goal and their main purpose.  was for having a block section is to address the queries and address the problem their users are having so that they can actually convert and start using the product, right?\n",

He proposes a trial for content creation to demonstrate the value of their services compared to cheaper alternatives, emphasizing the long-term benefits of quality over quantity in SEO and content marketing strategies.\n",
       "  > Waqas Arshad:  Their major focus is to only target the users which are interested and then convert convert them. So based upon the services and based upon the value proposition that we have, I believe our pricing is very much cost effective. And as for the main leaders in the market,  yeah okay i have a proposition for you by the way  you can try out i mean the people who are cheap in the market in the market and just try one article with me you can do a trial with me we can do paid trial with one article alone where we do a topic selection for your brand and write the content and then you can publish it and you can try provide some other chief agency as well and you'll have a benchmark of the quality that they are providing and what we are providing and then only then you will be able to actually feel the difference in what we have to offer and what other companies who are charging less are happening to you. Otherwise, it's just discussion that we're having. Maybe you can simply say he's just making blame excuses. He's just making claims and they're not doing something different. So only you can only figure out once you out once you try and benchmark it with some other service that are cheap i would say do a trial with me and do a trial with another company and then you can figure it out yeah okay  Okay. Okay. We'll get back to it. By the way, do you use Google Meet as your primary meeting app?  Yeah, we use Google Meet a lot, but we're not only using that.  We use Zoom as well.  We are using Microsoft Teams as well.  So, it's totally based upon what is the preference from the client.  And do you say any of the note takers available in the market?  As of yet, I'm not using any of them, but I do plan to use going forward.  Okay.  Um, so the use case I've been, uh, you have a non.  this specific call with you now is that I've been I've been checking the numbers Four pieces of content, 8, 6, 22, and the price is something I've missed by ear.  and that's something that I have and now I can do something like summarize the proposition So the proposition is content creation focus on high quality competitor analysis is your strategy.  the proposition the pricing I am so so that is uh something that can be done real time during the call and there's much much more after the call that's come down so So I encourage you to try it out, too.  It's free.  Yeah, definitely.  I can give it a try and see what we can do.  uh uh but what are your thoughts i believe you found the pricing to be very high as for your  budget right yes i i was feeling like uh is that like 150 bucks per article is something considered and considered pretty high  there was a time when i used to feel the same but once i get into this and the quality if you focus on quality There are companies which charge $1,200 for just one article.  There are companies in the market.  The main thing is what actually you are targeting at.  You're having a SaaS product.  and you want to make sure that your SaaS is recognized as an authority in your niche.  In order to do that, you need to actually focus on quality.  If you actually compromise on the quality and go towards quantity and go towards cheap SEO and cheap agencies, it will definitely, uh, fired back down the road because for one instance, you try a cheap SEO and you focus on quality quantity and you publish like 50, 80 or a hundred content.  10 pieces in a year or in like six months.  And then you actually realize, okay, it's not working out.  I'm actually getting some traffic, but it's not giving me any benefit.  We were at the end of the day, a million traffic on a website.  Like Alexa.ai is not going to benefit if it's not converting, right?  1000 traffic, which converted more value.  If you want to make it right at that point of Time it's going to cost you double because 100 content pieces that are already published should be revised again. A new SEO company will come and will do a complete audit on your content, will figure out what topics to retain, what topics to remove, It will take time.  Then they'll have to update the content and it's gonna cost you twice the money that you're gonna do it if you focus just on quality.\n",
       "- [25:26] This chunk occurs during a discussion between Waqas Arshad and Dmitry Grankin about content creation strategies for Dmitry's AI tool. Waqas emphasizes the importance of quality content and the limitations of relying solely on AI for content generation, while Dmitry expresses his interest in potentially outsourcing content creation. The conversation highlights the need for a balanced approach that combines manual processes with AI assistance to ensure effective content marketing.\n",
       "  > Dmitry Grankin:  need to dedicate some specific time for doing that the other idea is that you are suggesting is that just fully just fully fully outsource this thing or if that's a full outsourcing okay just uh give me an idea what what's going to look like okay because otherwise i have a clear idea how to uh how to proceed doing this myself in a kind of smart way which could be very dumb way as well we don't yeah  Dimitri, I would say you already have an AI tool that you have custom built.  So I must say that you are very much aware about the AI and the advent of AI in this niche.  I would like to add a few things here.  AI is a very good tool if you use it, obviously you know that, but if you talk about content that we are writing and publishing for the sake of convergence and for the sake of Google to actually recognize recognize it as an authority we can't completely rely on ai ai can be used as an assistant but completely relying for example if we select if we use air for the selection of a topic.  We can't make sure that the topic that AI is providing is relevant, right or not, was first thing.  Secondly, the main thing before we actually write a content is devising a proper content brief.  So a proper content outline has to be prepared so that we do know what's the main intent of the user with that query and what our main goal is in order for before we actually write the article. So what our goal is from that content is, but that has to be outlined first.  So if we use AI to create outlines, AI doesn't create very good outlines. So it's our experience and we have been talking with clients in the market.  So AI doesn't create very good outlines.  It has to be a very manual process.  So if you do it manually or with using AI, you can create tens of outlines within two, three hours.  But what process we follow?  It takes us like three, four hours to just create one content outline because the art process is completely manual and we have to actually read the articles that are ranking for that particular key.  So, I mean, We do utilize AI, but we can't completely rely on that.  Thirdly, once the outline is done, content writing is something we can do very good writing using AI, but again, don't properly humanize the content and if the content is not optimized as for the latest Google algorithms, it's not going to work.  Google is very smart.  It actually identifies the content, which is a return.  Not even writers who are actually very much aware of how to use AI tools or GPT or any other tool, they simply read it and they can even identify that it's not a human content or it's an AI written one.  Yeah, I got your point. We don't have that much time, so tell me one thing. Who is actually doing that?  No, no. I have a complete team in my company. So there is an SEO specialist.  I have a team of writers and then editors as well. So the best way to go is to go to the SEO specialist.  go forward with i was just explaining this because uh just to let you know our composite is completely manual and it's not focused on completely doing it automatically so it takes us like three four days to just craft one content piece that we submit. So our main focus is quality, not quantity.\n",

He emphasizes that consistent content efforts over six months can lead to a natural influx of visitors and enhance the product's visibility in search results for relevant keywords.\n",
       "  > Waqas Arshad:  So let's say you start working on this on your content marketing and your blogging side and you spend six months on that after six months you will actually start to see an inflow of traffic on the regular basis and it will be a continuous inflow right so you don't need To spend money and then people would be coming onto your website naturally without spending any money, right?  And it will be giving authority to your landing pages as well.  So people who are searching for the keyword, like for example, AI platform or AI meeting assistant or a transcription tool, they will actually see your product ranking overall.

But I think today there are many options from Google Workspace.  Like you have other providers more like less centralized as Google, as Microsoft.  And some people like, I don't like the idea of being stuck to any provider.  So I don't like that.  like the idea and your solution seems more like free. You install your Google Chrome adapter there and you can use it if you don't like it you uninstall it and your data is not being shared with like google or anything anything besides the thing that you chose to use So I like this approach of being less dependent on other existing ecosystems to work.  Yeah, and I-  Depends on Chrome, let's say.  If I use Safari, for example, I wouldn't, which is one limitation, but I think it's just a strategic moment that you are using.  using Chrome as a first implementation.

Yes, yes.  Yeah, I would love to use it for a while, to test it, to know, to like feel, how it goes because i would say that i am not that uh happy with it with the agents that i used so far uh one one agent that i was Usar o TLDV tem um problema que não identifica a língua, então eu preciso dizer manualmente que isso é um encontro português, isso é um encontro inglês.  And this is so bad because it's after the meeting, if it's not in English, it sends an email with a completely crazy, uh, uh, yes.  abstract of what happened and it's so weird yes having and i can't change the language after the meeting happened so it's it's pretty bad so it's not working for me and There is the other Fireflies, I think it's Firefly the name.  Yes.  Yes.  Something like, which is a little bit better dealing with languages, but has some other issues that I didn't like it as well.  Which ones are those?  Yeah, the Firefly, Firefly flies door AI.  Yeah, the fireflies.ai.  Yes.  Let me go into my...  the fireflies you need to have a google uh workspace account oh really allow you to use your ordinary gmail account for recording it so you need to be a company organization and you need to have Google Workspace, which is like also terrible because I don't wanna have Google Workspace to use or Microsoft.  uh whatever account so they they want you can't create an account if you don't have this uh if you don't use google if you don't use microsoft teams or uh anything as long as I know so it's it's not useful for individuals or for like people that don't want to use Google's tools especially people they don't they don't want to have all their stuff in Google or in Microsoft so that's why for Fireflies also doesn't fit my needs.

       "  > Dianna Lloyd:  So that's what I kind of put together a little spreadsheet and it's not fancy, but it's It just is a helpful way of just trying to understand that, that journey, you know, as they come through.  So, um, when I first started building mediums, I wasn't really aware of entry to the whole entire, you know, setting them off into a welcoming email workflow and all of that. So I went back and I just started looking at what the different workflows in And so the first workflow that I saw is actually this workflow here, which is the initial inquiry flow.  Yep.  Sorry, Diana.  Is there any way we can record this?  yeah just so that i can um send it to our colleague georgie who'll probably want to be across this as well okay i love that you always remember that sam  okay i i'm not i'm used to working in teams so recording is do do do i think if you press the  Yeah, me too.  I see more options. Oh, here we go.  Manage recording. Here we go.  Got it.  Do you want a transcript too?  whatever whatever's there yeah that's fine i'll just start recording okay\n",

       "  > Dianna Lloyd:  Then I started building the EDMs and had some questions so i went back and i looked at how do they how do they get into this whole this whole journey right and it starts out with this uh workflow which is the vd sales initial inquiry flow and just please correct me if I've got something wrong.  It's just this is this is what I found.  And if I have it wrong, please let me know.  So is this is this that workflow just from people entering an email on the website is that correct i believe so so it feels  fill out any contact us form inquiry right yeah so if i go to the mark I think it's anything on this website is what that's talking about.  And Samantha, by the way, I need to talk to you.  about this form here because it's different oh yes my um my colleague georgie  and our web developer who put it there are sorting that out for you  okay because you'll want to get all that information right yeah so I pass that I pass on  your message to them and they're just working on it so much easier okay so if I fill out a form where's  a good place to fill out form.  I'll go to contact us.  So this form here or any form that's similar in shape and size to this form fills out a contact in, um, with all the information into the HubSpot portal right so i believe this is a HubSpot form now so they fill out this form and they come in and samantha gets made the contact owner they're set to a new lead status they get a life cycle stage of lead and then there's a task created for samantha that gives them all the information um and they're set as a marketing contact and um They get this email, and this email, I'll just show it here, is basically, thanks for reaching out, here's our marketing checklist.  and we're excited to learn more about you and the expectation in that is that Samantha has some time to contact this person mm-hmm because you've been given that task.  Do I have the story right so far, Samantha?  Oh, she's gone.  She'll be back.  She'll be back, okay.  to you sorry I went to unmute my mic and I exited but yes that is correct all the time okay\n",
       "- [19:00] This chunk occurs during a discussion between Dianna Lloyd and Sam regarding the timing of automated email follow-ups in a marketing workflow. They are deliberating on the optimal delay for sending emails to new leads after they fill out a contact form, considering factors like response speed and recipient engagement.\n",
       "  > Dianna Lloyd:  So manual enrollment, and I've set it to delay for a day to give you time contact them i will delay it till monday tuesday wednesday or something like that i won't have it so that they get an email on the weekend if if you would prefer um  Sam, your thoughts on that? I don't mind if it arrives on a weekend.  Yeah, I would just, I think speed is the competitive edge, especially now. I agree.  so i would just delay for a day well the reason being is because they've just received as i said  they've just received this email yeah and then a lot too even in one day, you know.  Okay, so just a bit over 24 hours then.  So not the next day, but the day after.  Whenever they've done it, if they filled out the form  At 10 p.m., it'll be 24 hours later.  Okay, and that's fine?  Is that what you're recommending?  I do.  I recommend, some people like to wait until 10 a.m.  to send these, but what, um, you know, there's a lot of thought that people are on, on, they're on their phones, they're on their computers.  at the same times when they have that time to sit and play around with these types of things if you send it at 10 a.m you're most likely to hit people when they're in the middle of their workday yeah which isn't necessarily about  But if they are, I think you can assess how quickly people are opening because you're going to have that data.  So if I said it at two o'clock,  10 a.m. um then what could happen is they fill it out at 10 p.m. and it's 10 a.m. the next next day so it could be a day and then 10 a.m. or it be wait i don't know 12 hours it could be wait till 10 a.m the following business day so i i need my my suggestion would be to say just delay it for a day and have a look and see what happens agree and then we can do okay let's do that and do some a b testing so if they if they if they sent it at 4 30 then they're going to get the email at 4 30.\n",
       "- [17:48] This chunk is part of a discussion between Dianna Lloyd, Shannon Clegg, and Samantha regarding the setup and management of marketing workflows in HubSpot. Dianna explains the importance of the initial workflow in establishing contacts and outlines the structure of subsequent workflows, emphasizing the need for potential future adjustments to better cater to different customer journeys.\n",
       "  > Dianna Lloyd:  Um, okay, cool. So, where was I? Yes, so I finished talking about this. So, um this information this web this workflow basically sets them up as a good contact with the information that they need their marketing contacts so there's a lot of back-end processes that we need to be able to market to them and to give you some data and to set them on your workflow and your pipelines and all of that for creating them and making them a customer and creating a deal and all of that and it has the one welcome mail, which I just wanted to go.  That was the most important thing I wanted to point out.  So, um, the next workflow, then the way I've built it is that this workflow will be actually triggered out of this workflow so i'll create an extra little thing that comes out of here an extra action and it says go to this workflow yep so this one's doesn't have an entry point, it's completely rely on this one to send them on.  So in essence, it's a continuation of the same workflow.  Um, but later on, We might make some decisions to split them out and not do that, which is a later thing that I wanted to talk to you about, which is why I didn't say just continue the whole thing.  It's better to split them out if it's now this different nurture journey.  because we may have multiple things that come off the back of this in future.\n",

Dianna inquires about the typical response time for reaching out to new leads, and Shannon provides insights into their promptness in communication, while also considering future scalability for international markets.\n",
       "  > Dianna Lloyd:  um yeah so and when you get this notification in the workflow I just have a quick question for you about that one of my questions was is how long does it take you usually to try  reach out to that person uh like maximum two hours we're very fast yeah the only Any time it's long, like a long wait time is if it comes at like 4 a.m. or 3 a.m. and we're sleeping, but it'll be the first time.  Yeah.  Even if it's Friday night, I'll still respond.  and I see it, or I respond over the weekend, that's more than fine because I'm that person that checks my emails over the weekend, but If it's overnight, then no, it's the next morning.  If we're gonna future-proof this process moving forward, going into North America, the Middle East and Asia, it's probably that lead time will be longer. Yeah, of course. I mean, those that come in overnight are usually international.\n",
       "- [21:56] This chunk is part of a discussion between Dianna Lloyd and Sam regarding the content and strategy for a welcome email in a marketing workflow for Taurus. They are evaluating the messaging, specifically the inclusion of a checklist and the relevance of the Taurus brand versus Taurus Shop, ensuring clarity in communication for potential leads entering the workflow.\n",
       "  > Dianna Lloyd:  because that's when there's that's when they're commuting that's when they're doing stuff and they might go oh yeah right and they might have a look okay so sounds good your first email is a welcome and a bit about taurus noble The CTA, or the action that we've said, again, is that checklist, which is which is repetitive so I'll just it's not meant to shout in red but it's just so that I remember so um so to look at the email I've changed some of the wording to be, if you haven't already, be sure to download our free resource on Taurus Marketing Checklist. However,  Sam, is this a good point, is this a good email for us to embed the bullseye methodology and then link it through to the website?  Yeah, absolutely.  I think also the other thing to be careful of is Taurus isn't our bread and butter it's not it's not the only thing we do like we've been around for 29 years because people come to and really shop is for that Northern Hemisphere audience.  So it's not just about shop.  So is this when people buy from shop or is it just he's been there inquiring because he says welcome to Taurus shop I can answer  that the contact us trigger to bring people into this workflow has nothing to do a shop perfect okay so that's a good thing we've just uncovered because\n",
       "- [15:02] This chunk occurs during a discussion about optimizing a contact form in HubSpot, specifically addressing the inclusion of email domains and website URLs, as well as potential data validation features to enhance lead capture and management processes.\n",
       "  > Dianna Lloyd:  Is there, like we can say no Gmail addresses, things like that.  you know how it's been set up but um I can have a look at that and get back to you if I have any suggestions on the form other than that it's okay if some of them I know most  spams our Gmail or something like that.  But we did recently get a client who still uses a Gmail account.  So I wouldn't completely abort it.  I know it's quite a rare case, but he does.  And you might actually, now that I'm thinking about it, you might get URLs.  People don't have a URL because it's personal branding.  Is that possible?  That's possible.  Sometimes, yeah, that's possible.  And then the other thing is they don't have a URL because they're trying to build a new website or they're trying to launch.  i mean it's still maybe we just have it um it's there now so if they if they enter that's great  it just we can't make it if you're gonna have clients that don't if it's not completely b2b actually make it that yeah yeah okay so going back to this um sorry sorry just an afterthought  we could make it We could make it compulsory and if they don't have a website, I don't know if we can put an put in if you don't have a website, put in your LinkedIn profile.  You know, I don't think that can be done, but I'll have a look.  I look, I've built quite a number of forms on HubSpot and I've never been able to see anything that's not.  Yeah, that's fine.  There's some new stuff though with their forms.  There is some conditional data validation.  So let me have a look, okay?  Okay.  that's a good idea it was just an afterthought data validation and i don't know enough about it  You know more than I do, that's for sure.\n",

With the checklist?  Yeah.  Probably prior to my time.  Right.  So that's why it's worth I go in and just read  review each one of them but i just don't know where to go in from uh i think you just go in  from those links that diana had sent previously in the email i'll share this  document with you if you guys do you want it now yeah okay yeah that's good and then i can just  check them overnight for you yeah and i think now that we have the context it's a lot easier  to understand the flow\n",

Here’s a summary of the main points:\\n\\n1. **Product Features and User Base**: You highlighted the functionality of your product, which includes a dashboard that provides summaries and a chat interface similar to ChatGPT. This allows users to generate insights based on specific meetings or a collection of meetings. You mentioned that the product is currently in a free trial phase, attracting a stable user base with minimal marketing efforts ([1](/meeting/q)(/meeting/2a40c363-c52b-4f89-8719-e0be87591485)).\\n\\n2. **Sales and Marketing Strategy**: Jasper emphasized the importance of identifying target customers and crafting effective outreach messages. He suggested that a strategic approach to sales and marketing is crucial for growth, particularly for tools addressing enterprise privacy and knowledge management challenges. You discussed the need for a systematic approach to lead generation and the potential for your product to transition from a B2C to a B2B model ([20:31], [34:16]).\\n\\n3. **Challenges in Balancing Development and Marketing**: You reflected on the difficulties of balancing product development with marketing and sales efforts. You shared your experiences with hiring a product manager and the challenges of effective communication, emphasizing the need for founders to engage directly with potential customers to understand their needs ([11:33], [17:24]).\\n\\n4. **SEO and Competitor Strategies**: You mentioned the potential of using SEO tools to drive traffic and how competitors are leveraging YouTube transcripts to attract users. This insight could inform your marketing strategy as you consider ways to enhance visibility and user acquisition ([34:16]).\\n\\n5. **Personal Background**: The conversation also touched on your background, including your move from Russia and the political climate that influenced your decision to relocate ([20:31], [2:10]).\\n\\nOverall, the meeting provided valuable insights into product development, marketing strategies, and the importance of understanding your target audience to drive growth. If you need further details or specific aspects to focus on, feel free to ask!'"
