       "(08:08): Silver Paladin:  these bottlenecks is our api do not have any or do not have enough resources for work with I increased number of workers, a number of threats our API and it is our API API will be much, much, much, much productive, I think.\n",
       "(08:15): Enchanted Griffin:  So, but for now, the maximum load is\n",
       "(08:30): Silver Paladin:  is 40 users that was no no no no if uh if i increase our workers to maybe four uh i think we should work with uh one thousand users without\n",
       "(08:39): Enchanted Griffin:  Okay, we'll get back to it later. I got lots of questions about it.\n",
       "(09:15): Silver Paladin:  test our engine and i should check our streaming service which our front end sends the chunks audio chunks and maybe i should increase number of working of this api too okay is it all yeah yeah yeah that's all okay okay so i'm next okay is it all yeah yeah yeah that's all okay okay so next yep so good morning everyone uh\n",
       "(09:36): Inferno Nomad:  especially with the resource slowing down of his computer and not loading up transcriptions.\n",
       "(09:40): Inferno Nomad:  I have, right now I'm running on a MacBook.\n",
       "(09:43): Inferno Nomad:  So yesterday I tried different approaches.\n",
       "(09:51): Inferno Nomad:  The only time I was able to seemingly replicate Replicate it was when I had two windows running the extension at the time.\n",
       "(09:52): Inferno Nomad:  Other than that, I was unable to replicate it.\n",
       "(09:57): Inferno Nomad:  But right now I have set up on a MacBook and right now I'm recording the meeting.\n",
       "(10:23): Inferno Nomad:  still working on trying to replicate it but i have not been able to do so so um other than that uh yesterday i added some there's some render we uh added the markdown display for assistant um A number of bug fixes.\n",
       "(10:28): Inferno Nomad:  Today, I'll continue trying to replicate this issue.\n",
       "(10:34): Inferno Nomad:  While there are some other issues that Karine added back, I'll also review those and try and fix them.\n",
       "(10:42): Inferno Nomad:  But essentially, other than this, this resource issue and then the issue that uh dimitri is having with displaying transcriptions\n",
       "(11:06): Vortex Swan:  i i'll be reacting to both fixes um uh again i think please focus on bugs uh don't focus on on um on uh dmitry's issue uh at least today because uh you know it's it's it it's research on Dmitry's issue at least today because you know it's it's it's research so it so uh it might take we don't know how much time so please focus on uh fixing bugs because this might take we don't know how much time so please focus on fixing bugs because this affects\n",
       "(11:56): Breezy Sphinx:  Yeah, but still, still, let's today focus on bugs. And then we make performance a priority, we will make a call with Dmitry and try to figure figured out on his machine. So please focus on resolving bugs in Trello. And performance is definitely an important feature. But we'll focus on this a bit later. I mean, bit later is like It's like today or tomorrow. It's not like in a week or a month.\n",
       "(11:57): Breezy Sphinx:  Okay.\n",
       "(12:04): Enchanted Griffin:  And the debug is the primary bug, the constriction is not showing.\n",
       "(12:12): Enchanted Griffin:  get my desk now to check it out, if it's a result, a result, a result.\n",
       "(12:17): Enchanted Griffin:  Dmitry, sorry, I didn't get what you're saying.\n",
       "(12:36): Enchanted Griffin:  That I was facing was the which will be shown yesterday on my machine and Olga's machine as well yeah\n",
       "(12:47): Daring Tornado:  yeah so this is the main thing right now okay can I is done okay okay\n",
       "(13:03): Enchanted Griffin:  Okay, as for me, I've been doing some research on how to improve diarization, speaker diarization and further development and research on how to deliver.\n",
       "(13:16): Enchanted Griffin:  deliver a better product that's what i'm doing awesome that sounds good all right\n",
       "(13:19): Blazing Ninja:  okay you guys\n",
       "(13:28): Enchanted Griffin:  something yeah yeah no i'm not getting transcripts for this meeting but the assistant works\n",

       "(13:46): Supreme Rebel:  Let me check back end.\n",
       "(13:49): Enchanted Griffin:  Yeah, I'm actually getting some descriptions now, so.\n",
       "(13:50): Enchanted Griffin:  Yeah.\n",
       "(13:51): Supreme Rebel:  Huh?\n",
       "(13:56): Enchanted Griffin:  That should be something really easy, I think.\n",
       "(14:07): Enchanted Griffin:  should just maybe maybe do some player programming yeah yeah yeah it it would be should just maybe yeah maybe do some player problem yeah yeah yeah it it would be great to great to have it um\n",
       "(14:48): Supreme Rebel:  i have two meetings at the same time and can it be the reason yeah if you have two minutes at the same time i just noticed that there is yeah there is another meeting if you have to meet us at the same time but it didn't stop uh recording recording when I start with the second one in the same windows it should stop yes when\n",
       "(15:12): Inferno Nomad:  implemented? Yeah, we have it in, so we're supposed to have multiple windows, but we have it in, I think, in product backlog, I think, so something, yeah.\n",
       "(15:13): Inferno Nomad:  Yeah, it's a product backlog.\n",
       "(15:14): Breezy Sphinx:  We have this one.\n",
       "(15:57): Breezy Sphinx:  So, yeah, we need to check on this because it might be a bigger issue because we have off-screen documents shared between all the instances kind of hijack the session so we need to check on this how to make sure that one off-screen document is shared for potentially multiple instances even if they know that not actively recording and yeah okay anyways let me see the actively recording and yeah okay anyways let me see the code on this and code on this and Dmitry you home? Yeah. Oh interesting. Alright.\n",
       "(16:25): Titanic Gladiator:  okay okay guys i'll jump to another call now yeah thank you guys thank you bye see you guys bye\n",
       "(01:25): Aurora Guardian:  We start recording.\n",
       "(01:33): Aurora Guardian:  Noisy.\n",
       "(01:39): Aurora Guardian:  No, I don't hear anything.\n",
       "(01:46): Aurora Guardian:  Maybe it's my keyboard.\n",
       "(01:48): Aurora Guardian:  Ah, yeah.\n",
       "(01:50): Aurora Guardian:  This is...\n",
       "(01:52): Aurora Guardian:  Uh-huh.\n",
       "(02:26): Aurora Guardian:  five and nine Okay, let's wait. I can...\n",
       "(02:32): Aurora Guardian:  Sorry, guys.\n",
       "(02:47): Noble Mercenary:  someone try to generate new download link\n",
       "(03:03): Harmonic Astronaut:  yeah no no i see uh the lock that someone tried to generate an invite link with the wrong token\n",
       "(03:04): Blazing Storm:  Oh, really?\n",
       "(03:05): Harmonic Astronaut:  Yeah.\n",
       "(03:06): Blazing Storm:  That's interesting.\n",
       "(03:08): Blazing Storm:  oh really yeah that's interesting we have an imposter We have an imposter.\n",
       "(03:11): Harmonic Astronaut:  maybe it's dmitry Maybe it's Dmitry.\n",
       "(04:06): Mystic Wanderer:  Very, very badly. Very quiet, very quiet. I don't know, maybe just me.\n",
       "(04:59): Phantom Paladin:  the Trello and seeing what we want to deliver in the next 24 hours after this one is done, so let's be very brief.\n",
       "(06:06): Phantom Paladin:  let me share my screen now um so basically um yeah as Dmitry told we need the transcription um working like 100 percent of the time and as Karina suggested yesterday and andre uh like let's focus on one topic so it was a really good proposition so yeah we can focus on transcription and everything that uh related to this um so let's go through through the list and see So yeah, this one is least uh sharing audio is not allowed for sharing is the same uh youtube recording goes here Previous meeting processing goes here.\n",
       "(06:09): Phantom Paladin:  Invalid token show error message.\n",
       "(06:23): Phantom Paladin:  So yeah, this one needed because it's very needed because uh the problem is oh let me start extension uh\n",
       "(06:33): Tempest Warrior:  sorry Where's my extension?\n",
       "(06:33): Tempest Warrior:  Where's my extension?\n",
       "(06:38): Phantom Paladin:  I disabled it, okay.\n",
       "(06:38): Phantom Paladin:  I disabled it, okay.\n",
       "(06:46): Phantom Paladin:  So now again, we need to inject extension So now again, we need to inject extension also on the action click.\n",
       "(06:46): Phantom Paladin:  also on the action click 100%.\n",
       "(06:48): Phantom Paladin:  100% we need that.\n",
       "(07:10): Phantom Paladin:  So it worked in the previous version, like the one that was never used in production, the one they sent you.\n",
       "(07:13): Phantom Paladin:  And they show you it's very simple to do.\n",
       "(07:18): Phantom Paladin:  Check if we can detect not alone type audio capturing is the same.\n",
       "(07:19): Phantom Paladin:  Minimize panel.\n",
       "(07:21): Phantom Paladin:  So, yeah, panel is...\n",
       "(07:23): Phantom Paladin:  is done.\n",
       "(07:26): Phantom Paladin:  So this one is archived.\n",
       "(07:32): Phantom Paladin:  The mute microphone is not displayed in the extension UI after not allowing audio and sharing the tab.\n",
       "(07:43): Phantom Paladin:  It's the same, we have three of them all together, Check if we can detect, oh, I just wasn't saying.\n",
       "(07:49): Phantom Paladin:  Smart transcript, yeah, so this is the same.\n",
       "(07:53): Phantom Paladin:  I did not scroll the last message.\n",
       "(08:08): Phantom Paladin:  I have a separate card with bug red colored for this. I think we have multiple cards.\n",
       "(08:17): Scarlet Alchemist:  yeah yeah yeah it seems like each pack there is an open card for that\n",
       "(08:32): Phantom Paladin:  Yeah, this one is important.\n",
       "(08:37): Phantom Paladin:  Make sure not all data in fresh meetings.\n",
       "(08:37): Phantom Paladin:  Yeah, this one is important. Make sure not all data in fresh meetings.\n",
       "(09:42): Cosmic Guardian:  um issue if someone reloads the extension everything is connected that's what that card I don't think that's not even a- Retain scroll position.\n",
       "(09:48): Phantom Lightning:  Yeah, so we have one, two, three, four, five, six,\n",
       "(10:10): Phantom Paladin:  four cards for the scroll Skip duplicate here Retain description data on the screen Uncomplete and recording After I can see. Yeah, so we have\n",
       "(10:36): Rustic Architect:  That's amazing test not very but oh, yeah, my 17 almost And ready for QA\n",
       "(14:44): Phantom Paladin:  So This goes Here so far check if we can detect not allowing goes here if needed microphone Love goes here The same timer works for two simultaneous meetings Yeah, we need to address two simultaneous meetings, but maybe we can focus on them for the next sprint sprint the timer of the previous meeting Is displayed after the meeting is the same a document on our Okay, we there yet. There's a lot of multiple active recording Sweet shirt up during recording. So this was kind of to think about Make a check if audio capture is active periodically. Yeah. Okay. This would be for later This would be for later The first suggestion is really one system such in trying to drag. Oh, yeah, this I think is fixed second page after install this is about Settings page after install so we need also The main and links you yeah, so I will not put it here. We need to focus on transcription and then this is As well, but yeah Mmm, yeah, okay Check out your всем recording screen well, yeah far we need to We will need to find how Apps to Not bea rid of the errors make switch between chat branches yeah this is to think about page close reload before extension stopped yeah pay attention we need to pay attention but this is not transcription fix echo when extension is enabled on the page probably still needed yeah it's still needed it still makes but it's not transcription it's a different thing so uh uh initial extension on arbitrary web page and icon okay so this one is uh yeah uh dmitry already put it um audio microservice separate audio processor from the riser um andre if you're here could you let us know about this uh cart muted okay yeah uh how do you have microservice do you need anything do you do you know anything about it oh no i don't okay no worries no more okay yeah i'll put it here i don't know uh either speaker names from native google vcc we need it but later uh using only specific stopped after pause button uh interesting uh check okay let's see like to base I think this is\n",
       "(14:52): Cosmic Guardian:  done yeah even uh streaming not stopped after pause button I think that's done but let's test\n",
       "(16:10): Phantom Paladin:  it probably can we check okay yeah yeah yeah please check and um okay I will put it then here and please make sure to put it either well in incorrect place uh back after restarting computer and then opening google meet and see like a timer continue to run I think this is done yeah yeah yeah not open and automatically all the time I think this is done I never saw it wasn't open I think uh the problem is that sometimes it's hidden but this is different uh different uh problem implementing design setup from figma yeah this is not there yet it does not open all uh it does not open all the times not sure what it means to be honest but yeah we need to probably check on this like never saw it doesn't open that youtube go back uh although it worked it opened on youtube but we need to fix it uh change it later interface call names ai interface call names okay so this is a different\n",
       "(16:20): Solar Lion:  thing yeah this is about determination of meeting uh meeting name by using ai I bet this is super\n",
       "(16:31): Phantom Paladin:  interesting task for you guys um update connection choice behavior to ensure no gaps inside meeting may arise due to connection switch.\n",
       "(16:48): Phantom Paladin:  I think we did it and tested it with, oh, sorry, it's a backend, it's a backend, but still may arise due to kind of behavior to ensure no gaps inside meetings that may arise due to connection switch.\n",
       "(16:50): Phantom Paladin:  I think we need to put it here.\n",
       "(16:53): Phantom Paladin:  Yeah, Dmitri, yeah.\n",
       "(16:57): Phantom Paladin:  Change that icon where recording is in progress would be a good feature.\n",
       "(17:04): Phantom Paladin:  Show previous call in, yeah, okay, this is a good feature for.\n",
       "(17:07): Phantom Paladin:  That's, is it in call or dash?\n",
       "(17:20): Phantom Paladin:  It's in call, so basically when we have a call and we have transcription and this is a recurring call, we want to see previous messages, but this needs to be discussed with Dmitri, basically.\n",
       "(17:30): Phantom Paladin:  My idea is that we show button to user, like what do we want to see from the next meeting, you know, like do we want to see a summary or you want to show full summary?\n",
       "(17:31): Phantom Paladin:  Oh, sorry, just a summary.\n",
       "(17:32): Phantom Paladin:  Transcription.\n",
       "(17:37): Phantom Paladin:  The whole, yeah, the whole text, but this is like not yet here.\n",
       "(17:40): Phantom Paladin:  Change tab icon, yes, indicator.\n",
       "(17:45): Phantom Paladin:  A call is not authorized, check.\n",
       "(17:53): Phantom Paladin:  Indication is PA, I have no idea what it means.\n",
       "(17:59): Phantom Paladin:  Ask Dmitri, but in case.\n",
       "(18:00): Phantom Paladin:  Okay.\n",
       "(18:04): Phantom Paladin:  I want to highlight and copy part of text, can't do it.\n",
       "(18:10): Phantom Paladin:  Yeah, this is important and this is for transcription, so right now we, like, text is unselected.\n",
       "(23:11): Phantom Paladin:  uh start with default mic uh yeah this also important part of the ux keyboard keywords to highlight not yet um not yet not yet make sure timer always means recording well this is you know i think this related to uh periodically check andre was you said did you say anything uh no okay export into copy buffer and format that google docs supports uh questionable do like we have markdown google docs support we need to work on that a bit but this is related to yeah not directly and this is a for here and edit labels and all this would be improvement so we want to avoid improvements until after we done with the very basic stuff the token with the blank is accepted long field is accepted um yeah i need some basic uh verification um on this so this also part of the user experience so let's put it here and this is very simple task um i think uh the minimized extension icon is not displayed in the pre-meeting page and displayed for a second after the reload um well uh yeah this need to be checked on as well part of user experience um copy the bug info this goes for later the name speaker goes for it stays here um a testing routine for each build uh well we need to yeah work on this so let's put it in to do somewhere here um it wasn't clear that i should select the microphone to start recording yeah well um definitely this part of experience and this is about the default microphone rename speaker try to use the default microphone and this is about the default microphone rename speaker try to use on the meeting well i ask season make something it doesn't work i can send it by enter i can push one button uh yeah i think this is part of the experience we need to uh try to use the meetings it didn't open at all well yeah i need to i think it's ready for qa now because it might be uh not the case anymore upon extension installation the mic sign is misleading yeah we need yeah agreed so we need only but this is improvement let's stay here major performance issue with some users i don't know what to do about it ah yeah this is about uh macos yeah so we need to There are message so, okay Error message talking error message example. Ah, no, okay you mean I I I Have feeling that I created Okay, you created it that Karina did I think Yeah, because I remember I was creating this this cart was this images\n",
       "(23:13): Eclipse Wanderer:  Okay\n",
       "(23:51): Phantom Paladin:  Error message and this is How do I say it? I Think I think I think Yeah, this goes to this validation. Where was that? Okay. Yeah, it goes here The transcriptions are erased I think that this was fixed\n",
       "(23:57): Amber Siren:  No, it is not. It is not. Okay\n",
       "(24:00): Phantom Paladin:  well this this Is yeah, I think\n",
       "(24:12): Amber Siren:  That's not really that's not a bog. It's you know, you know, the API of dates Transcription, so you could have to yes time and then when it comes again those two are compressed into one so that's what's happening\n",
       "(24:13): Inferno Nomad:  Yeah\n",
       "(24:19): Phantom Spartan:  So it's not being erased. It's actually being Yeah\n",
       "(24:27): Eclipse Wanderer:  But when I compare to the I think it is also\n",
       "(25:25): Inferno Nomad:  erased from the back end yeah yeah it's the back end that's merging it and returning so they could be three before then when the back end merges it the back end will return like two so that's what's happening just to make sure that the text in the previous assuming they were three previously that the three texts when they are merged appear in the two so if they if they compare and they are really and they are similar then that's what's fine it's only if something gets missing like they were three before or they were four before and then when they compress into three some text didn't come back so then that's probably an issue and change and so this could be not the issue this could be actually a feature but let's check on this\n",
       "(27:49): Phantom Paladin:  okay we're getting close to the bottom the initial username is not displayed in the ui after scrolling up in the description yeah so this one i think it's super simple it's just a margin or something like that extension doesn't work well that's too specific i don't know well um i think we need to test it where we add speaker assistant upon extension installed yeah no mix sign is misleading this is default mic time uh bug that's i don't know we need to work on that probably but uh meeting one six can switch my camera i can copy transcription use from for summary it didn't work so i think we need to test it again retest it um when copy transcription i copy the last part only last part of the text yeah this is this is actually important one uh and it does paste partially uh at least paste partially can see transcript it was but disappeared i think we need to test it again the orange button becomes larger and smaller yes this is and this is a very very small fix assistant text input oh yeah let's keep it outside for some time um system chat disappeared after switching to transcription i think this is done yeah that's done yeah so it being kept uh but me minor mic show multiple times um yeah i kind of make sure you don't do that because i i also saw it\n",
       "(28:04): Cosmic Guardian:  uh yeah that's that's that was a that test build i sent to karen initially then sent to dimitri so that's why i did it so yeah it's not gonna be good um after a lot i can't see my previous\n",
       "(28:18): Phantom Paladin:  prompts and assistant answer uh well yeah i think we need to keep that but we'll keep it for the next uh sprint and see how after reload meeting has ended so unless you're\n",
       "(28:33): Cosmic Guardian:  starting to load history for even if you are loading history the api already knows the meeting id so you have to guide the hp i should just return transcription yes but uh assistant i think\n",
       "(28:41): Phantom Paladin:  yeah so yeah with assistant we we need to manage it but we don't know how exactly uh right now\n",
       "(28:58): Cosmic Guardian:  i think we can see i'm doing that already in the dashboard so i think we can just do the same thing when you load it just makes an api call to fetch all transcriptions for that meeting so in the time for this work so we can just do the same thing for system assistant i don't i'm not sure if\n",
       "(29:09): Phantom Paladin:  assistant is stored it's not no no no let's not discuss it right now let's put it uh resource limitation on the server i think this is\n",
       "(29:22): Zephyr Mercenary:  for backend uh it is about our issue for the on this morning uh we limited or by gpu of our server\n",
       "(32:44): Phantom Paladin:  yeah okay um all right so this is pretty much like a lot of it is duplicate so um a lot of these are simple like this probably is not existing uh at test and route uh so this one not for developers uh scroll to the newest messages scroll scroll scroll so for them um then invalid token show message and then we have uh oh no it's different things but i still put it on the bottom but we need to take care of it uh scroll scroll scroll retain user scroll position same uh yeah same same same same transcription data on screen yeah this is important one two then data in fresh meetings uh important i ask assistant to make summary it doesn't work so yeah i just need to make sure that this work and allow um yeah i think that's pretty much about transcription everything some ux stuff yeah i'll put ux actually back on ice for some time the token with the blank field accepted token validation or message yeah maybe the token as well it's not token token microphone no microphone is important here yeah should we do the mic yeah i think we need to work on microphone as well because this is um yeah well yeah i need to check on this microphone minimized exciting meeting uh and copy it like okay i'll put it back uh so yeah that's pretty much it invalid token show error message uh well this is important part it's also important important part but this is but yeah okay i'll put it on the very uh bottom okay guys so this uh this would be it i think uh for the next like 24 hours and then we have some uh issues uh and like yeah really good progress on uh cleaning up work in progress so this for the next i believe uh 24 hours because it was it was empty when we started this call so um from my side that's it uh let's uh um meet today at what time do we need we meet at uh 3 p.m 3 p.m yeah yeah awesome that's that's it from my side any questions suggestion um i don't know that super uh do you need me for anything we can stay on the call\n",
       "(32:53): Nova Raven:  no i think i will walk over these cards and if i have questions i will do it um\n",
       "(33:26): Phantom Paladin:  thank you sounds good awesome guys thank you so much let's do some some some progress again customers are really really expecting uh you know new version like existing customers that working right now with awful version but they do and then you new customers who using you know own solutions that we can provide they also like very interested to see this thing in action so let's deliver as soon as possible and yeah let's focus only on important things so have a good day everyone and i'll see you next time thank you guys bye-bye So yeah, and thank you guys for your input yesterday.\n",
       "(33:27): Phantom Paladin:  Really appreciate it.\n",

       "(06:04): Pristine Pegasus:  some issues with it at the beginning so we yeah let's prepare the extension for uh release but again this is like very very soft release so it will not be published in web store instead of will be sent as archive just like we do right now so again if you could finish the microphone to select the default microphone by default that would be great and we will be ready to send out our time are we\n",
       "(06:04): Sage Raven:  looking to start\n",
       "(06:15): Pristine Pegasus:  I'm not sure but I think like as soon as possible because it's Friday and it's I'm not sure, but I think as soon as possible, because it's Friday and it's already half already half of the day in some regions.\n",

       "(06:21): Spectral Spider:  First of all, which builds should be released?\n",
       "(06:56): Cosmic Architect:  doesn't trust it doesn't transcribe i'm good i get transcriptions do you have because i don't have right now i'm not getting books earlier this month morning i was getting transcriptions i'm getting now even i'm getting now\n",
       "(07:15): Inferno Nomad:  currently end up talking like you enter your token in the options page\n",
       "(07:22): Eclipse Wanderer:  i turned it but there's nothing there yeah so if you enter\n",
       "(08:02): Inferno Nomad:  type there it will not actually update so you just you have to use the link the full link with main should work so i think your token is invalid because it's not getting the right token because you use that form that form is already it's not completely so i should generate a new token you can just use your token link the full link yeah okay so you just use the full link in your browser then you refresh the extension okay\n",
       "(08:07): Eclipse Spartan:  and then i will do\n",
       "(08:36): Twilight Rose:  I have arranged some test cases.\n",
       "(08:44): Twilight Rose:  brought down around 50 but there are still a lot so i i think i will finish it\n",
       "(10:48): Inferno Nomad:  that has been replaced with a loading icon when you're transcribing it doesn't update it just keeps loading i don't know what i want to do about that i didn't test it Yeah, I can see it's in QA, so if you do TBD, if you know we are changing the TBD to a loading icon to indicate that it is still trying to determine the name of the speakers right so if at the point that is doing that you then end like end recording it will just be like it's not going to update it's just going to be like that so i don't know what we want to do about it and what is surprising that uh i had the meeting running and when i switched to our meeting it didn't stop the time i have two simultaneous meetings running yeah that's still an issue that we have not worked on it So if you have two meetings running, it's going to be sending transcriptions to one.\n",
       "(10:56): Inferno Nomad:  If you have two meetings running, it's actually supposed to stop both meetings.\n",
       "(11:03): Inferno Nomad:  The way you start recording meetings Yeah, it stops when I start the meeting.\n",
       "(11:08): Inferno Nomad:  You will not see transcriptions in one, but you'll see in the other one.\n",
       "(11:25): Inferno Nomad:  So if you have a transcription running and then you open a new tab and start a meeting, both transcriptions will stop, right?\n",
       "(11:32): Inferno Nomad:  Then if you then start one, it'll be sending transcriptions to the old, to the previous meeting.\n",
       "(11:33): Inferno Nomad:  It's not going to be sending transcriptions.\n",
       "(11:35): Inferno Nomad:  to the old so the previous meeting it's not going to be sending transcriptions uh it's my voice low Is my voice low?\n",
       "(11:37): Inferno Nomad:  Is my voice low?\n",
       "(11:42): Twilight Rose:  No, you're good.\n",
       "(13:13): Inferno Nomad:  another meeting like you open meet.google.com and start another meeting in a new tab it's going to stop the previous meeting from transcribing right but then if you start recording the new meeting it's going to be sending transcripts transcription you're going to see transcriptions in that new meeting because it is sending an approach for multiple meetings so when we see how what ought to be about that day we'll fix that and let me check my token thanks okay do we have anything to discuss me from me nothing from me except um so i don't know what to do about uh this card in to do this uh upon extension installation no mic sign is misleading i don't know how we want to handle that\n",
       "(13:18): Spectral Champion:  I think we had some suggestions.\n",
       "(13:22): Inferno Nomad:  Must be default mic.\n",
       "(13:25): Inferno Nomad:  OK.\n",
       "(13:26): Spectral Champion:  i don't know if you had some suggestions must be default mic okay okay so that's how we said\n",
       "(13:27): Inferno Nomad:  OK, so that's how we set default mic, right?\n",
       "(13:28): Spectral Champion:  Default mic.\n",
       "(13:50): Blazing Griffin:  Mm-hmm.\n",
       "(13:50): Blazing Griffin:  Not for life.\n",
       "(13:51): Twilight Rose:  We can go, huh?\n",
       "(13:54): Blazing Griffin:  I'm also, yeah, I told everything.\n",
       "(13:56): Blazing Griffin:  Bye.\n",
       "(13:57): Twilight Rose:  OK.\n",
       "(13:59): Blazing Griffin:  All right, guys, bye.\n",
       "(14:00): Blazing Griffin:  Bye, guys.\n",
       "(14:02): Blazing Griffin:  for you to send out.\n",
       "(14:17): Avalanche Rose:  Well, actually, yeah, we have two-day sprint, so, yeah, good time to synchronize.\n",
       "(14:18): Avalanche Rose:  Okay.\n",
       "(02:17): Blazing Oak:  And please, please, please tell that, you know, that's it. That's all. Let other people know that you finished let's go okay i'm working on the latest version i opened some cards in the trello but to be honest i moved to work in progress by myself, since I found some. I think they will be fixed as soon as possible, I think, no big issues. But I have Question regarding to timestamp in assistant, because when I ask for summary, it brings me another time that I have a screenshot.\n",
       "(02:23): Blazing Oak:  If you want, I can share, but it's like the speaker started, let's say 90 AM.\n",
       "(02:37): Blazing Oak:  and it shows 6 a.m. and in the assistant when it brings me the summary let's say this speaker started the speech at this time and these are different the times It shows 6 a.m. and in the assistant when it brings me the summary, let's say this speaker started the speech at this time and these are different, the timestamps are different in the assistant and transcription.\n",
       "(02:40): Blazing Oak:  times are different in assistant and transcription this is one issue I don't\n",
       "(03:02): Spectral Tiger:  operates in UTC time exactly three hour difference I know but the user how how\n",
       "(03:14): Blazing Oak:  they know the users yes I know what is the reason but like if they are asking For the summary, for the users, it is different and not understandable.\n",
       "(03:34): Iron Comet:  okay let's let's discuss it a bit later because um basically the request yeah yeah the feature\n",
       "(03:39): Dreamy Rose:  requests on box are different things very related to each other so we know what we're talking about\n",
       "(03:42): Cosmic Wizard:  Well, for user, it's a bug, definitely.\n",
       "(03:46): Cosmic Wizard:  But yeah, we need to think and talk about it.\n",
       "(03:46): Cosmic Wizard:  But yeah.\n",
       "(03:47): Cosmic Wizard:  Yeah.\n",
       "(04:00): Spectral Turtle:  in full screen mode extension ui showing full screen mode i\n",
       "(04:08): Blazing Oak:  think yes if you click on full screen let's say the meeting it disappears disappears oh really\n",
       "(04:19): Cosmic Wizard:  Okay, I didn't start mine, so we will check later.\n",
       "(04:23): Cosmic Wizard:  Okay, yeah, please put this as a bug in to do.\n",
       "(04:23): Cosmic Wizard:  okay i didn't start mine so we will check later okay yeah please put this uh as a bug in to do\n",
       "(05:00): Blazing Oak:  is not displayed when we stop the meeting minimize the extension and maximize the assistant history again is not there yeah please put this uh as a button i did and also yes when we stop recording uh reload the extension reload the meeting um\n",
       "(05:14): Crimson Storm:  When we stop, we lost it.\n",
       "(05:20): Avalanche Rose:  Sorry, guys, so we really went deep into discussing issues.\n",
       "(05:25): Avalanche Rose:  But like, OK, there is specific issues that you found.\n",
       "(05:25): Avalanche Rose:  That's good.\n",
       "(05:32): Avalanche Rose:  Let's discuss it after the daily is done.\n",
       "(05:33): Crimson Storm:  Sorry.\n",
       "(05:34): Avalanche Rose:  Yeah, no problem.\n",
       "(05:44): Avalanche Rose:  no problem we could spend like another 10 minutes discussing all these three uh things so let's just let other um teammates\n",
       "(05:49): Crimson Storm:  Okay, I move this card directly to work in progress by myself.\n",
       "(06:00): Avalanche Rose:  No, I mean, you can put in work in progress if it's in QA, then you put in work in progress, if not, if you...\n",
       "(06:13): Avalanche Rose:  new cards just put in to do okay okay um okay okay thank you okay\n",
       "(08:09): Mystic Spellbinder:  is good i can fully emulate as many users as i want via python so now i'm trying to create some useful output a quality matrix based on the testing results uh for now i think we have some battle bottlenecks in our back end i should our metrics later okay now there is one problem my lot testing can affect real user or our team and I don't know what I should we don't have production environment you could test when yeah okay let's discuss this but right with uh clients even uh the closest one and uh yeah so which which is the reason i can start my load testing only on on my my money on my money yeah okay that's all okay uh good good day everyone um um money on my money yeah okay that's all okay uh good good day everyone um um today bringing\n",
       "(09:06): Dynamic Giant:  King on the dashboard on Friday like continued working trying to fix up some minor issues that came up on the dashboard and I was working on those earlier today so I'll finish them at least gets fixed up the minor issues I don't know if it's possible to deploy the dashboard this uh sorry today if it is possible we'll probably go through the uh deployment process and have it issues essentially fixing up important issues with karine and then deployment of the dashboard and other issues with the dashboard also fixing that goes up too so that's those are the things i have for today except something else comes up but that's all for me from\n",
       "(09:15): Polar Wanderer:  awesome thank you okay guys um as of what i have in my mind for now is\n",
       "(09:36): Mystic Wizard:  Which is the messages that are disappearing in the front end. That's the most critical thing that we should concentrate on, I believe. Maybe some other critical bugs.\n",
       "(09:39): Mystic Wizard:  one of which is pretty obvious to me.\n",
       "(09:58): Mystic Wizard:  Another, we've decided that we go for one which is pretty obvious to me uh another we've decided that we go for our authentication our authentication to to be able to later deploy uh to to be able to later deploy uh the um dashboard uh and uh yeah the dashboard and\n",
       "(10:08): Dynamic Giant:  It's working authentically.\n",
       "(10:11): Dynamic Giant:  I didn't hear you clearly for like the past 30 seconds.\n",
       "(10:12): Dynamic Giant:  So.\n",
       "(10:13): Mystic Wizard:  Okay.\n",
       "(10:13): Mystic Wizard:  Okay.\n",
       "(10:14): Mystic Wizard:  Again.\n",
       "(10:22): Mystic Wizard:  So again, what I find most important for now is first Bucks feed.\n",
       "(10:50): Mystic Wizard:  box fix which is transcript messages loading assistant messages loading so which then after we'll be able to deliver and deploy the user's dashboard.\n",
       "(11:23): Mystic Wizard:  Okay, okay, so we should probably focus on identification today likely is that that yeah so first we need we need to fix the most critical box i believe on the front end which is transcript loading messages and maybe we could discuss what is most critical.\n",
       "(11:42): Mystic Wizard:  And yeah, but I think that's transcript. Then we, for the next, for the next, this sprint, we wanted to deliver authentication.\n",
       "(12:33): Mystic Wizard:  right uh yeah and and then what what comes new to us is more what is important in terms of the feedback from the users is is that we want to parse zoom parse zoom url and use uh yeah to deliver uh to to support zoom in uh web zoom on web parse zoom url and use uh yeah to deliver uh to to support zoom in uh web zoom on web zoom post shouldn't be more difficult than a youtube but i find that youtube is buggy for some reason for some reason there are some discrepancies in the real interface um yeah yeah\n",
       "(12:54): Dynamic Giant:  some there is style inflow from youtube into the extension because we are displaying it some there is style inflow from youtube into the extension because we are displaying it in in content directly we are not wrapping it in kind of a shadow dome it was in a shadow content directly we are not wrapping it in kind of uh a shadow dome it wasn't a shadow done before dome before but because we wanted to animate with google meet it had to move out of the but because i wanted to animate with google meet it's hard to move out of the shadow dome if we shadow dome if we are not trying to like animate into you know that google meets to get are not trying to like animate into you know that google meets creating it then we would have been\n",
       "(13:47): Mystic Wizard:  planning for next spring but for for this spring uh yeah we were supposed to deliver authentication and fix existing box so that that is for for now until as far as I remember yes yes correct and an authentication is pretty pretty much some information to the chat about that.\n",
       "(14:08): Mystic Wizard:  Yeah, it's a very, you know, everybody is involved into this process and back end and front end, and we all need to make some decisions on the approach.\n",
       "(14:21): Mystic Wizard:  are going to implement actually so let's spend some time getting prepared for that and have another quick meeting on that today i suggest\n",
       "(14:32): Avalanche Rose:  Sounds right. Yeah, so as we discussed, like, no functionality really matters if transcription is not working.\n",
       "(15:08): Avalanche Rose:  So, I mean, it doesn't matter if we have fontification or whatever it is, Sounds right. Yeah. So as we discussed, like, no functionality really matters if transcription is not working. So I mean, it doesn't matter if we have fontification, or whatever it is, if the transcription is And on identification side, so, yeah, Dmitry, I think this is a really good example how we can do the only one endpoint protected by...\n",
       "(15:14): Avalanche Rose:  this identification token to actually create the token.\n",
       "(15:35): Mystic Wizard:  We have iterated this over chat GPT and basically I think I got a clear solution for that, but we need to discuss that.\n",
       "(15:49): Polar Wanderer:  You have hand?\n",
       "(16:10): Frozen Specter:  Just one question. When the extension is opened on the transcription tab, and when I move to assistance tab, minimize it and maximize, it goes to transcription tab. Is it the way it should be?\n",
       "(16:55): Mystic Wizard:  work or it should be opened on the assistant tab yeah just um i think it's a good thing to remember and to add to trial or to to fix that okay so always to keep state and to add to trial or to to fix that okay so always to keep state um for now i got transcripts starting from 10 18 so even the today's session is not delivered in full but we've got multiple sessions on\n",
       "(17:16): Blazing Oak:  all sessions on this on this meeting and one thing about the recurring meetings when i have running a meeting and when i join to our recurring meeting the previous one doesn't stop But in general, when I start two meetings, the one stops, for sure.\n",
       "(17:31): Iron Comet:  Yeah, we have, okay, okay, so yeah, we still have this card in the backlog, we ...didn't get there to prohibit two simultaneous meetings at the same time, so for some.\n",
       "(17:43): Iron Comet:  up and he can stop it there and start a new one.\n",
       "(17:51): Iron Comet:  And later we can deliver two simultaneous meetings being recorded.\n",
       "(18:03): Iron Comet:  But yeah, it's not the first priority right now.\n",
       "(18:17): Iron Comet:  but yeah the the it's not like uh for not the first priority right now okay uh so I\n",
       "(18:41): Spectral Tiger:  And then planning for authentication, but yeah, okay.\n",
       "(18:44): Spectral Tiger:  And Andre is now doing load testing anyways.\n",
       "(18:56): Iron Comet:  So, but we'll probably fail Sprint to deliver authentication tomorrow if we don't do anything about it.\n",
       "(18:59): Iron Comet:  If we don't do, then we definitely fail.\n",
       "(19:07): Iron Comet:  I think there is still a really good chance to deliver a notification.\n",
       "(19:10): Iron Comet:  So, Karina?\n",
       "(19:23): Blazing Oak:  Yes, and one more thing. When the user is not identified, identified, it loads very long, and when we stop the meeting, it still loads.\n",
       "(19:27): Blazing Oak:  The recording, I mean, not the meeting, when we stop, it still loads.\n",
       "(19:36): Sage Prophet:  uh you mean the transcript is coming yeah i mean it's like when the user is\n",
       "(19:48): Olympic Cheetah:  not identified and it's still old no okay so that's why the icon that's a tbd The icon, so I I mentioned it like I think on Thursday.\n",
       "(19:53): Olympic Cheetah:  So when we stop recording, icon so i i mentioned it like i think on thursday so when we stop recording do i should i change it do I should I change it back to just CBD?\n",
       "(19:59): Olympic Cheetah:  But because you know we're not making an API call back to just tbd but because you know we are not making an api call to update the tbd the name to update the CBD, the name actually.\n",
       "(20:00): Olympic Cheetah:  So the loading icon is still\n",
       "(20:24): Zenith Comet:  Yeah, so yeah, yeah, OK, OK, just call transcription, no audio, just transcription, transcription like two or three times.\n",
       "(20:25): Iron Comet:  Yes, yes, yeah, yeah.\n",
       "(20:30): Iron Comet:  Pull transcription API.\n",
       "(21:09): Spectral Tiger:  for minutes after the recording is finished mm-hmm right cool okay so but yeah we want first of all we want all the transcriptions all the assistant messages persistent and test thoroughly on these different occasions like collapse in under collapse and switching between back and forth and all the stuff should work so that's number one\n",
       "(21:36): Iron Comet:  okay yeah okay make sense I will deploy the dashboard right now in after 11 of the second.\n",
       "(21:41): Iron Comet:  So yeah, about after 11.\n",
       "(21:47): Iron Comet:  So, yeah, about after 11 and then with And then with authentication,\n",

       "(04:27): Flaming Wasp:  we can separate regular calls within the one meeting from each other, so it's very cool and important for us, so today I will do my best to realize it.\n",
       "(04:44): Sylvan Rose:  to realize it one or two hours and everything will be uploaded okay good morning okay so i\n",
       "(04:45): Fierce Maverick:  kind of i didn't\n",
       "(04:52): Sylvan Rose:  Okay. I didn't know you had a call this morning. I thought it was end of spring school.\n",

       "(05:04): Fierce Maverick:  Okay.\n",
       "(05:33): Fierce Maverick:  Okay, so yesterday we did a checklist all the items on the checklist except the uh export copy like to copy all transcriptions and export it as text file for uh dashboard uh i had to switch to working on google auth and that is more or less done now also i did the the on Google Auth, and that is more or less done now.\n",
       "(06:15): Fierce Maverick:  on Google Auth, and that is more or less done now. Also, I did the UI components to ATSD Also, I did the UI components to ATSD, and today tested it with Andre, and that works to log in with your Google account to get stuck in for both extension and dashboard now but currently it only works with test users and there are only three test users now so if you need if you want to use it after add your email address to the test before you can log in otherwise you won't be able to log in so with your Google Auth on the dashboard uh fixed a number of issues today you won't be able to log in.\n",
       "(06:17): Fierce Maverick:  So it's Google Auth on the dashboard.\n",
       "(06:19): Fierce Maverick:  Fixed a number of other issues.\n",

       "(08:15): Phantom Pegasus:  Today I checked and I think it is, but I want to check it once again.\n",
       "(08:27): Glowing Prophet:  Yes, with the new build, I tried, and it worked.\n",
       "(08:30): Glowing Prophet:  For the first meeting, it was okay.\n",
       "(08:33): Glowing Prophet:  I want to check for the current meetings.\n",
       "(08:35): Phantom Pegasus:  Is it being published?\n",
       "(08:38): Phantom Pegasus:  I can't see it published.\n",
       "(08:42): Phantom Pegasus:  Was it published? The new build?\n",
       "(08:45): Emerald Tsunami:  No, no, no, no, the last one.\n",
       "(09:11): Vibrant Tiger:  In compliance so because it's many times when I'm gonna start testing something, you know, and she said like it works But then we don't have it available. So every time we need to figure out so let's just make sure that you send all the bills via the conference\n",
       "(09:21): Fierce Maverick:  you send all the builds via the confluence, and you just can, you know, say, like, add some nodes about stability.\n",
       "(09:25): Fierce Maverick:  So it's like, you know, dev build, not about stability.\n",
       "(09:29): Fierce Maverick:  So it's like, you know, dev build, or this is like release candidate build.\n",
       "(09:37): Fierce Maverick:  Okay, because most of the builds I send are like, when there are items, sometimes, even if checklists or items, and I just, when I fix one or two, I'll just send that sometimes so she can test them, be sure that both things are working.\n",
       "(09:48): Fierce Maverick:  So generally when I then fix probably a lot of issues, send her something so she can test and be sure that both things fixed are working so generally when i then fix probably a lot of issues then upload but i'll upload the one she has now\n",
       "(10:09): Vibrant Tiger:  We can use GitHub, I think, to publish tags, builds, yeah.\n",
       "(10:18): Vibrant Tiger:  So we need to explore this, but let's do every build just publicly available, and then Karina can tell which one she's using, and if it works, then we all can download the same build.\n",
       "(10:36): Fierce Maverick:  using using and if it works then uh we all can download the same build so i think it's just make more difficult if you send it directly basically okay all right media are you talking to us because you need it yeah\n",
       "(10:39): Guardian Astronaut:  All right, Mitya, are you talking to us?\n",
       "(10:40): Guardian Astronaut:  Because you muted.\n",
       "(10:45): Guardian Astronaut:  Yeah, okay, so most important are the bug fixes for now.\n",
       "(10:49): Glowing Giant:  So, yeah, we want to see them gone.\n",
       "(10:54): Titanic Alchemist:  And then authentication, I...\n",
       "(11:07): Fierce Maverick:  yeah and then i was the uh authentication i i yeah uh i i hopefully will finish by by today And then authentication, I hopefully will finish by today, by the end of the sprint, right?\n",
       "(12:23): Fierce Maverick:  it may still need to do other things but i don't think it will affect front end anymore but more or less let's just assume authentication on the front end is done unless there are ui changes that need to be done okay that i'm done sounds good okay all right guys then uh let's have uh let's have the demo review uh today at uh what is that free okay how how quickly can you publish this uh for the dashboard so that karine can go through it and then uh yeah just uh notify me it's super fast like i i can do it really fast okay okay because i will need so in case she he finds anything so that i can just fix yeah no i'm i'm at the computer today so update is very fast\n",
       "(01:57): Obsidian Rebel:  Okay, guys, let's get get started uh let's be really quick about uh current status and i would want to show you something really quick too\n",
       "(02:03): Luminous Turtle:  i think andrew will go first right no usually\n",
       "(03:01): Flaming Voyager:  on the dashboard authentication didn't work i have some issues raised in the backlog cards opened and um there the main issue is still uh the missing transcripts and authentication please we have issues okay uh but please be more specific The transcripts in the dashboard, when I put timestamp in the backend, it displays the part of the specific message.\n",
       "(03:19): Inferno Eagle:  Did you get when you put not related to API for transcriptions when I put timestamp for a specific message it is this\n",
       "(03:24): Flaming Voyager:  wait only partially but in the ui we can see the whole transcript\n",
       "(03:34): Inferno Eagle:  okay uh if you could visually visually um make a quick video on that later today\n",
       "(03:44): Flaming Voyager:  I did. I have screenshots for if we have timestamp and the case when we don't have the timestamp. It is there.\n",
       "(03:57): Inferno Eagle:  something new not an old problem with transcript no it's not an old problem\n",
       "(04:14): Flaming Voyager:  with transcript it's something new uh i think uh all the issue is with timestamp it's we have some yes related issues with it okay it's we have some yes related issues with it okay is that all\n",
       "(05:05): Fiery Champion:  to close to the final result but I need one or two hours to finish it also I talk with Dmitry and and almost implement our access control it's a tempo feature dmitry tell you about this or already did i don't know yeah i will\n",
       "(05:20): Twilight Wanderer:  just right after we finish with the current state yeah okay so i try before our our daily sprint meeting\n",
       "(05:29): Fiery Champion:  i tried to finish our calls feature and access control feature that's all okay\n",
       "(05:39): Fierce Vulture:  With the Google Login, I have done the...\n",
       "(05:46): Fierce Vulture:  Okay, so I have the EOI design for the login page now completed.\n",
       "(05:50): Fierce Vulture:  Complete, also it's linked with the Google Login button.\n",
       "(06:58): Fierce Vulture:  so you click the button it locks you in and takes you to the dashboard so you click the button it locks you in and takes you to the dashboard but this morning but this morning karine showed me an issue with the login itself so i think it's a configuration karine showed me an issue with the login itself so i think it's a configuration thing so when thing so when you try to log in and the pop-up the google pop-up comes up it doesn't you try to log in and the pop-up the google pop-up comes up it doesn't load when you check i need to figure out why that's happening and fix that other than that i think the login itself is okay it's just the configuration issue that's costing to return 403 um today i have done the ui today i'll be adding it to the extension like to the browser extension so that if you're not logged in to bring up the login mode dial and ask you to log in primarily today, in addition to fixing the issue with the login on the website, on the dashboard.\n",
       "(07:27): Fierce Vulture:  So I think I may not even need to fix that because we are transitioning from logging in using the button on the dashboard to using the login page like a proper login page so that may not need to be fixed on the on the dashboard itself the ui issues that currently mentioned with the dashboard yeah those two i'll fix those today\n",
       "(08:26): Inferno Eagle:  okay that's it yeah that's it for me okay uh so let me show you something and yesterday with the product team and our UX developer designer we have and yesterday with the product team and our ux developer designer we have developed for this developed for this flow as mentioned yesterday as we've and quick access to the to the system uh though implemented somehow of uh some kind of access control and that's what uh andre is briefly mentioned Okay, let me give you a quick walk through this thing.\n",
       "(09:25): Inferno Eagle:  change token google talking to our internal token then backhand checks if this specific user is in a list of allowed users okay uh if if not allowed then uh we are showing that uh you are in a waiting list or something if uh if they are allowed we check if extension is installed installed If that is not the case, we route them to the whole marketplace.\n",
       "(10:32): Inferno Eagle:  when they install the extension go through settings page and when they install the extension uh go through settings page and uh which here again we check which here again we check if they are authenticated if they are not authenticated if they are authenticated if they are not authenticated they are they end up here again place what that that's why we want to check if they're sophisticated and if they have the extension basically it's a straightforward um more straightforward they are starting from landing page authenticate and here we check if their uh dashboard is empty having no meetings, then they just end up with the dashboard.\n",
       "(10:58): Inferno Eagle:  If they are empty, they see some kind of wizard explaining how to use the product and just in for just a link to Google meet to try it out so tell me if it's clear what questions you've\n",
       "(11:15): Fierce Vulture:  yeah the i got for the extension street for my body bottom part did it too uh yeah no just after extension installed that yeah yeah that's I can't even see it clearly. Maybe you can\n",
       "(11:19): Inferno Eagle:  zoom in. Yeah, I can just share it with you, I suppose.\n",
       "(11:19): Fierce Vulture:  so i can't even see it clearly maybe you can zoom in yeah i can just share it with you i suppose\n",
       "(11:20): Inferno Eagle:  Okay.\n",
       "(12:20): Inferno Eagle:  I'll do it with okay uh with uh i'll do it with uh with so about what we need to do to deliver that quickly because basically we have almost everything in place we will have some extra UX extra design features delivered by designer really soon and let's see what Let's make a list of things we need to do, actually, to have it delivered.\n",
       "(12:23): Obsidian Rebel:  Okay.\n",
       "(12:32): Inferno Eagle:  Or, or better, I would, I would open up a, a Trellon.\n",
       "(13:04): Fierce Vulture:  okay chrome marketplace how do you go from chrome marketplace to checking if authentication um we have to return back to a page that we own to do that check yeah we there is uh there is a\n",
       "(13:10): Inferno Eagle:  hidden path to it i suppose what how does it work for now let's\n",
       "(13:30): Fierce Vulture:  So if you are going to Chrome Marketplace, you have to find, we have to find a way to look, to get the token, let me see what I'm trying to get to.\n",
       "(13:34): Fierce Vulture:  This is assuming that the person has visited\n",
       "(13:49): Inferno Eagle:  the third intermediary before right uh we don't know it's a it's a possible third intermediary before right uh we don't know it's a it's a possible entry point in yellow we've entry point in yellow we've got two entry points\n",
       "(14:24): Fierce Vulture:  please and then we just take them to our landing page or dashboard so if you're not logged in if you're not logged in you will land on the old if you are logged in you go straight to dashboard you're not logged in you will land on the old if you are logged in you go straight to dashboard\n",
       "(15:19): Inferno Eagle:  more specific about what's what's the current uh what's what's the current flow they uh we have this uh url that is patching that is that is patching the cookies right yes yes and we we want to and we want to invoke it If you can't and if not, then what?\n",
       "(15:22): Fierce Vulture:  Then not to take them to our login page.\n",
       "(15:43): Inferno Eagle:  To our login page and basically they do it here, this intermediate uh this uh ex this token exchange and and cookies installation we do it here intermediary this intermediary thing right uh\n",
       "(16:08): Fierce Vulture:  intermediary yes yes yes yes right now if you log in from the dashboard it will click up it will open the link because the backend is just returning a link so it just uh open that link in the new tab that link will write to intermediate so yes yes that's the flow a new tab that link will write to intermediate so yes yes that's the flow now okay so basically at\n",
       "(17:15): Inferno Eagle:  now okay so basically at this point we we add cookies this uh point we uh we add the cookies uh we we exchange first we exchange exchange tokens our own token uh as an internal token and we patch uh cookies right at this point we have gotten our token we got because once we finish who holds we have our token we have already done the token exchange so Basically, to start again, landing page, Outh, exchange tokens, check if they are allowed that is on Andre to deliver the endpoints to add to allowed list to remove from allowed list.\n",
       "(17:17): Inferno Eagle:  and to check if they are allowed.\n",
       "(17:26): Inferno Eagle:  And then we check if, can we check if extension is installed on the user system?\n",
       "(17:38): Fierce Vulture:  But the extension can check if took in and stuff, but the web page itself cannot check if the extension is installed.\n",
       "(17:43): Inferno Eagle:  Let's research this.\n",
       "(18:44): Inferno Eagle:  they can because our the UX guy he is also a front-end he said that he did this to check to he was checking this to check to he was checking if it's possible is that possible to check if on the user browser yeah as I from and developer okay can be challenging due to security in privacy restrictions however some methods\n",
       "(18:58): Fierce Vulture:  okay um there's i think there's a way an unconventional way that we can we can\n",
       "(19:01): Inferno Eagle:  check cookies right yeah we can check cookies you\n",
       "(19:16): Fierce Vulture:  yeah we can use cookies yeah that's on a specific page the extension can write to the page cookies to the web page cookies and then we can read that yeah yeah so we'll be patching cookies after installation as well right here yeah at at\n",
       "(20:30): Mystic Wizard:  Yes, we'll have multiple sessions, each dedicated for one session, yes.\n",
       "(21:14): Mystic Wizard:  okay but now okay thank you so yeah we decided we'll patch cookies somewhere to check to check if extension is installed on the user system and yeah here we want to check if system is empty we'll deliver some user experience Figma designs for that.\n",
       "(21:18): Mystic Wizard:  We will get it delivered really soon.\n",
       "(21:20): Mystic Wizard:  Yeah.\n",
       "(21:34): Mystic Wizard:  it's it's pretty much it and uh yeah we want to get it delivered as soon as possible to uh It's pretty much it and we want to get it delivered as soon as possible to eliminate difficulties.\n",
       "(21:57): Fierce Vulture:  So edge case will be if I install the extension, then uninstall it.\n",
       "(22:00): Fierce Vulture:  I'll be able to go through this flow, actually.\n",
       "(22:04): Fierce Vulture:  What's the edge case you're seeing?\n",
       "(22:12): Fierce Vulture:  So if, for instance, I install the extension now, or they don't install it, then go through this process.\n",
       "(22:17): Fierce Vulture:  The website, it will see me as having this extension installed when I don't have it installed.\n",
       "(22:41): Fierce Vulture:  Right, when you install an extension, I can write it a cookie right on install an extension you're not allowed to actually do anything so you can't do anything like you don't the extension does not know that it's being uninstalled the best you can do is to redirect to another page We can handle it with our own pieces.\n",
       "(22:43): Fierce Vulture:  We can redirect to our own page.\n",
       "(22:45): Fierce Vulture:  We can unset that cookie on that page.\n",
       "(22:46): Fierce Vulture:  Yeah, we can do it. We can handle it.\n",
       "(22:58): Inferno Eagle:  though it's because they were were deleted.\n",
       "(23:01): Inferno Eagle:  They deleted it and we don't know about it.\n",
       "(23:23): Fierce Vulture:  Yeah. What you can do on extension on install, you can direct to like on after installed you can direct these out to a web page we can use that to unset the like on after installed you can direct user to a web page we can use that to unset the cookie if cookie if the web page is on the same domain as our dashboard so i think we can handle that we the webpage is on the same domain as our dashboard so i think we can handle that we can handle that okay yeah\n",
       "(23:59): Enchanted Sphinx:  extension is stored yes no um we only need a web page which is not a part of this flow again When you uninstall it, this is an install and use flow, not an uninstall flow.\n",
       "(24:10): Fierce Vulture:  Let me just do something.\n",
       "(24:30): Inferno Eagle:  Yeah, we, by the way, we could, you know, get accommodated to this thing and iterate this, thinking over, and if there are any, Any doubts about it, we can make another call on that later today.\n",
       "(25:09): Inferno Eagle:  But basically the idea is that, yeah, it looks like it's the right thing to do now because basically we don't we don't have that much in trail i suppose work in progress dashboard fixes authentication assistant don't respond on entry make sure or yeah just to tell me can i if you got like at this time something that you're really working hard on something is that you'll be disrupted with with with this okay uh right now what hard on something is that you'll be disrupted with with this okay uh right now other than\n",
       "(25:30): Fierce Vulture:  speed right that's the biggest task i have now which is we are not completely which is\n",
       "(25:39): Inferno Eagle:  basically a part of this yes yes yes it's a part of this so so that this this thing doesn't control\n",
       "(25:45): Fierce Vulture:  with anything basically yeah it doesn't really interfere with it yeah it's like the\n",
       "(26:14): Inferno Eagle:  of, you know, pressure from, to think it over and not, sometimes you just need time to see at things and then you'll be possibly find some discrepancies.\n",
       "(26:39): Inferno Eagle:  in this flow and the if any let's get into it but basically for now i i think from the and and what else I can see that we need to to publish the obviously we need to\n",
       "(26:49): Fierce Vulture:  publish extension right ok so right now I think we have the first three steps\n",
       "(27:29): Inferno Eagle:  yeah we have the first three steps yeah let's let's you know convert this into Okay, so, we need to publish extension.\n",
       "(27:55): Inferno Eagle:  In order to, in order to publish extensions, do we need to do anything with the build to get it to put it for publishing uh right now we don't\n",
       "(27:57): Fierce Vulture:  We don't need to do anything.\n",
       "(28:04): Fierce Vulture:  There's nothing we need to do, to do anything there's nothing we need to do but nothing more about from assets but nothing morally, apart from assets, but to the extension itself, we don't need to do anything.\n",
       "(28:10): Fierce Vulture:  but to the extension itself we don't need to do anything but assets for the But other assets for the web store, but those will be on the website itself.\n",
       "(28:12): Fierce Vulture:  web store but those will be on the website itself okay and do you want are\n",
       "(28:27): Inferno Eagle:  We just then need to publish, right?\n",
       "(28:28): Inferno Eagle:  Yeah.\n",
       "(28:30): Inferno Eagle:  We just publish.\n",
       "(28:34): Inferno Eagle:  Okay, what else on the back end?\n",
       "(28:39): Inferno Eagle:  And we need to...\n",
       "(29:21): Inferno Eagle:  it's to do the allowed lists allow allowed like we need what we need we need 3m API in points which is an add email to allow remove and check is that correct and andre andre i i'm not sure why we need a check api\n",
       "(29:38): Fiery Champion:  I'll authenticate via Google, I don't know, I'll check the user email by myself.\n",
       "(29:41): Inferno Eagle:  Okay, you already have it.\n",
       "(29:56): Inferno Eagle:  now you'll just add at uh this uh you need to you you don't need any specific endpoint for that but You don't need any specific endpoint for that, but you need to check with the existing flow of chat tokens.\n",
       "(29:58): Inferno Eagle:  you need to check uh uh with the the existence uh uh flow of token exchange right okay so\n",
       "(30:18): Fiery Champion:  trigger uh the checking of allowed list yeah got it uh yeah i i don't need any\n",
       "(30:29): Inferno Eagle:  we don't need any extra endpoints for this yeah okay good okay then on uh what what else So, what else you cannot tell me?\n",
       "(31:05): Fierce Vulture:  at least waitlist message more or less probably to apply for the waitlist we'll need uh the wizard essentially the guide that's for that's a ux thing right\n",
       "(31:29): Arcane Wolf:  Yeah.\n",
       "(31:39): Arcane Wolf:  How do you want to handle this logout?\n",
       "(31:54): Inferno Eagle:  We'll see how it's been developed in the user in Figma.\n",
       "(32:16): Fierce Vulture:  Okay. Because if this all looks out from dashboard, they are also that from extension right yeah okay maybe uh should we add that to the flow or wait for it it separates yeah i don't know what the action is so it separates one say it again should we have it as part of the action list or a separate discussion\n",
       "(32:36): Inferno Eagle:  oh I mean I have wake understand and go for delivering this specific flow.\n",
       "(32:36): Inferno Eagle:  Yeah, yeah.\n",
       "(32:45): Inferno Eagle:  So let's concentrate on the things that we can, that are required to deliver the thing, this thing as soon as possible.\n",
       "(32:47): Inferno Eagle:  Okay.\n",
       "(32:57): Inferno Eagle:  for now talking extension page this is authenticated yeah uh we need to extension\n",
       "(33:11): Fierce Vulture:  Once the result is done, I think these are the actions.\n",
       "(33:37): Inferno Eagle:  OK, good, then let's bring it bring it all together push push through the production we need install extension\n",
       "(34:08): Fierce Vulture:  we need to have a message on the google meet like the content ui itself for when a user is not authenticated so if you are in a meeting right you have the extension installed but you are not authenticated we need to handle that case yeah uh that that's what i i suppose will be uh handled we will be you know covered with the yeah uh that that's what i i suppose will be uh handled we will be you know covered with the new\n",
       "(34:33): Inferno Eagle:  we'll still you know Google authentication is work as As an extra\n",
       "(34:38): Mystic Tsunami:  Publish yeah\n",
       "(35:08): Inferno Eagle:  nothing really changed from the you know uh from inside the system we just exchange And I think let's concentrate on the obvious things and the edge cases, we'll capture them while testing.\n",
       "(35:15): Inferno Eagle:  So yeah, if there is anything obvious we can see that\n",
       "(35:25): Fierce Vulture:  That will be quick.\n",
       "(35:34): Fierce Vulture:  Okay. Let's do that, but we also need to handle this extension log out.\n",
       "(35:41): Fierce Vulture:  Because if you're publishing the extension, we're making the extension public now, It means anybody can install it, right?\n",
       "(35:50): Fierce Vulture:  And when they install it and open the extension, means anybody can install it right and when they install it and open the extension the only what the only what will happen is when they try to start recording to record for one second and it will stop.\n",
       "(36:12): Fierce Vulture:  will happen is when they try to start recording to record for one second and it will stop they They won't see, they will know why it's not working, but that's just won't see they won't know why it's not working but that's just what's going to happen to them Redirect them to our login page.\n",
       "(36:16): Fierce Vulture:  For instance, without an account, and we'll add them to our login page.\n",
       "(36:19): Fierce Vulture:  But then they decide, okay, I don't want to register, and they close it.\n",
       "(36:21): Fierce Vulture:  Then go back to the extension.\n",
       "(36:31): Fierce Vulture:  They will be able to see records start recording everything will look fine they will just start recording stuff yeah we need to\n",
       "(36:52): Inferno Eagle:  I think it should be clear that they can start recording for them and that they have a link, a path to get into...\n",
       "(37:07): Fierce Vulture:  Okay. We can, when you start recording, if you don't have a token, we can load up the login page for you. I think that will handle it, right?\n",
       "(37:17): Fierce Vulture:  So if you try to start recording without talking, you just open a new tab and ask you to sign in.\n",
       "(37:22): Quiet Ranger:  That's an easy way to handle it.\n",
       "(37:24): Inferno Eagle:  Okay, let's go for an easy way.\n",
       "(37:32): Inferno Eagle:  Yeah, and then we'll fix if it doesn't work.\n",
       "(37:32): Inferno Eagle:  Yeah, and then we'll fix if it doesn't work.\n",
       "(37:33): Quiet Ranger:  Let me ask you something now.\n",
       "(37:36): Fierce Vulture:  Maybe we can add it to the action list You can add it to the action list so that it can be added to the cart.\n",
       "(37:36): Fierce Vulture:  so that it can be added to the cards.\n",
       "(37:41): Quiet Ranger:  Yeah, go for it.\n",
       "(38:09): Blossom Turtle:  I think this was always, at least in the short term, this was always.\n",
       "(01:57): Mystic Wizard:  Больше по фронту отстаём.\n",

       "(06:06): Rebel Tornado:  Hey Karina. Okay, so then you start.\n",
       "(06:08): Enigmatic Sage:  Me?\n",
       "(06:09): Rebel Tornado:  Yeah.\n",
       "(06:22): Enigmatic Sage:  Okay, I was testing the last card in my Ready for Q&A, For API calls, um, I found there, um, we discussed it with.\n",
       "(06:46): Enigmatic Sage:  there were some validation errors and he's fixing that that's all yeah all right so I almost done\n",
       "(06:58): Polar Vulture:  on this session task about 90 done uh i need just uh you know a little bit more finish this On this session task, about 90% done, I need just, you know, a little bit more finish this task and test it.\n",
       "(07:24): Polar Vulture:  Also, as Karina said, create a new endpoint for akena i can uh uh asked uh attend this list\n",
       "(07:31): Vibrant Tempest:  yeah the list of members of meeting right yes yes users for speakers\n",
       "(07:48): Guardian Wasp:  I think so you know in the updated Figma design there is an attendees so beside the copy transcriptions there's a number of attendees so it should be I think use that That's I don't know.\n",
       "(07:50): Mystic Wizard:  OK.\n",
       "(07:51): Mystic Wizard:  Yeah.\n",
       "(07:55): Mystic Wizard:  Maybe we push it for the next version?\n",
       "(07:56): Mystic Wizard:  Yeah, yeah.\n",
       "(08:09): Mystic Wizard:  That will be actually harmful because this number doesn't represent the reality for now oh okay okay yeah so yeah let's let's push it a little\n",
       "(08:22): Fierce Vulture:  More or less completed, I can sign on for a dashboard.\n",
       "(08:26): Fierce Vulture:  It's completed, probably not deployed yet, but at least I'm done on that.\n",
       "(08:31): Fierce Vulture:  And we're able to start logging process on extension now.\n",
       "(08:36): Fierce Vulture:  So you can log In the background, but the content UI doesn't know yet.\n",
       "(08:37): Fierce Vulture:  So that's what I'm working on now.\n",
       "(08:41): Obsidian Rebel:  So once I have that fixed, then would have completed logging\n",
       "(08:50): Fierce Vulture:  from the extension UI itself.\n",
       "(09:26): Fierce Vulture:  Also the video I played yesterday, I don't know if you want to do anything about it, So, you know, we have, yeah, we have not gotten to allowed.\n",
       "(09:32): Inferno Eagle:  We have, okay, let's start from here.\n",
       "(09:38): Inferno Eagle:  We've got, How, what's about the, uh, the page?\n",
       "(09:40): Fierce Vulture:  Yeah.\n",
       "(09:49): Fierce Vulture:  So the UI itself, uh, we, uh, we are trying to log in from inside the extension as opposed to dashboard from dashboard login, that's fine.\n",
       "(09:52): Fierce Vulture:  was from inside the extension itself.\n",
       "(09:58): Inferno Eagle:  So again, the question probably is this, this page is done, right?\n",
       "(09:59): Inferno Eagle:  So this page.\n",
       "(10:19): Fierce Vulture:  design changed so i need to make it black the only difference i'm making is the black and then the text color that's that because that's different it's different from the previous design so i'll just update these colors but this is done itself okay so the author\n",
       "(10:28): Inferno Eagle:  itself is done as well right yes yes and it's working for just right like in production or itself is done as well right yes yes and it's working for just like like in production or some\n",
       "(10:37): Fierce Vulture:  no no it's still on my lookout what some carrier no no it's still on my local what it's on my local but we can actually deploy it\n",
       "(11:27): Inferno Eagle:  that that's about both extension and the dashboard uh if we're if you're about authenticating inside extension that's a separate thing uh yeah but uh basically the flow the this one we start from uh landing to oath here is the page we've logged in i'm talking to the um user browser right what about this thing\n",
       "(11:36): Fierce Vulture:  uh that's on backend uh the front-end component is the waitlist we don't have that I don't have a UI design for that.\n",
       "(11:46): Fierce Vulture:  But on the backend component itself, I don't really need to do anything from my end, apart from display a page that tells you\n",
       "(12:45): Inferno Eagle:  yeah for now you can just take some something from compile something from from this just just you know just message in that whatever just just put the place folder for that you're in the waiting list or something that whatever just just put the placeholder for that you're in the waiting list or something we'll uh we'll fix that okay okay but yeah should should be working um will uh will fix that okay okay but yeah should should be working um and waiting for the you know installed uh how do we actually check this extension installed yeah so uh\n",
       "(12:48): Fierce Vulture:  Yesterday, I did a bit of research.\n",
       "(12:54): Fierce Vulture:  There's a way to communicate from a web page, um yesterday i did a bit so there's a way to communicate from a web page like for a for a web page to send information to an extension.\n",
       "(13:00): Fierce Vulture:  webpage to send information to an extension so i saw that on google on a google's extension doc I saw that on Google's extension doc page.\n",
       "(13:20): Fierce Vulture:  Logging is working, but the extension itself does not know that you are logged in yet.\n",
       "(13:21): Fierce Vulture:  So that's what I'm working on.\n",
       "(13:37): Thundering Eagle:  But again, we have in extension, like extension send message to a page, i believe and the page ah no it's content script ah yeah sorry disregard yeah yeah yeah yeah\n",
       "(14:07): Fierce Vulture:  your own web page and background but it means you have to code it into the web page it's not like as if it's content script so that's what I I just figured that out yesterday so that's what I that's what the approach I'm going to take for letting the background know a login page that's letting background know from login page that you're signing.\n",
       "(14:11): Fierce Vulture:  So essentially login page will send message to background.\n",
       "(14:33): Inferno Eagle:  okay now we've got this page uh and uh and the router itself yeah so like we are then four Forwarding to one of these.\n",
       "(14:36): Fierce Vulture:  Yeah, we have this.\n",
       "(14:40): Fierce Vulture:  forward into one of these yeah we have we have this we have we have this on the down but we We have this on the down, but we don't have the up one.\n",
       "(14:43): Inferno Eagle:  Yeah, the wizard.\n",
       "(14:45): Fierce Vulture:  Yeah, yeah, we don't have that.\n",
       "(14:46): Inferno Eagle:  And the wizard is...\n",
       "(15:07): Inferno Eagle:  don't have the op one yeah the wizard yeah yeah we don't have that and the wizard is OK, and so where do you think we are to deliver in this?\n",
       "(15:09): Inferno Eagle:  What things are missing?\n",
       "(15:16): Fierce Vulture:  The login page to background page to background communication.\n",
       "(15:21): Fierce Vulture:  and extension login detection.\n",
       "(15:35): Fierce Vulture:  Detection, which I should complete in about an hour, then.\n",
       "(15:40): Fierce Vulture:  With with the login detection, I think.\n",
       "(15:47): Fierce Vulture:  We more or less done OK, yeah, I suggest that\n",
       "(15:59): Inferno Eagle:  that we for now concentrate on delivering from, from here up to, up to here, okay?\n",
       "(16:24): Inferno Eagle:  will be like a bit later just just let's push it through to get the flow working from authentication down to dashboard and around.\n",
       "(16:32): Inferno Eagle:  Yeah, how can we achieve this?\n",
       "(17:22): Inferno Eagle:  down to dashboard and and around yeah um how can we achieve this like in the fastest way possible something like this waiting list just put some kind of placeholder we'll fix that yeah yeah so we will fix the details but we need to to deliver since this thing working okay and as for what is this uh you know design elements on the we also need to publish the new a new build right yes\n",
       "(17:28): Fierce Vulture:  Yes, yes, yes. Once I fix this extension login, I'll probably upload a new build.\n",
       "(17:32): Inferno Eagle:  Okay. So we need to-\n",
       "(17:36): Fierce Vulture:  But the other thing is we need to also publish the dashboard for it to work.\n",
       "(17:38): Fierce Vulture:  So it's kind of both of them have to\n",
       "(17:50): Inferno Eagle:  who have the hand so okay and uh to publish dashboard we need to yeah you got the access to the to the google to the google cloud is that all right\n",
       "(17:56): Fierce Vulture:  For now, it's Sergi that's handling the publishing.\n",
       "(17:59): Fierce Vulture:  Yeah, I can publish it.\n",
       "(18:08): Fierce Vulture:  So I just, I'll push an update for the dashboard, push for the extension, then generate a build for the extension and hit publish.\n",
       "(18:24): Inferno Eagle:  The thing is that this all workflow is broken unless we have ... something published.\n",
       "(19:16): Inferno Eagle:  So, I suggest we need to publish whatever we have for now, won't be able to play to see the action yeah so basically the early feedback can begin that the better yeah at least from the testing team all of us are so let's for now let's like upload something that if there is get it and just let's pack it and publish otherwise let's publish whatever we have now\n",
       "(19:27): Fierce Vulture:  login would not work on extension not that it's not just work So let me fix that first.\n",
       "(19:36): Inferno Eagle:  I mean, does it actually break the flow if there is no login on the extension?\n",
       "(19:36): Inferno Eagle:  I mean, does it actually break the flow if there is no login on the extension?\n",
       "(20:05): Inferno Eagle:  Means like, we don't actually risk anything if we upload first version to the public.\n",
       "(20:06): Inferno Eagle:  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.\n",
       "(20:09): Inferno Eagle:  Yeah, so let's get it.\n",
       "(20:20): Majestic Eagle:  Let's get it done and just a few hours later we can update the new thing.\n",
       "(20:28): Fierce Vulture:  So right now this is how it is and I don't I'm talking, it asks me to sign in, right?\n",
       "(20:39): Fierce Vulture:  It is signing me in now, it has signed me in, but because the extension doesn't get informed.\n",
       "(21:15): Fierce Vulture:  right now which is what i'm trying to fix if you click here again it's asking to sign in again you see that yeah so this is what i'm trying to fix so once i have this but if if since i'm signing now if i go here and i refresh like refresh it will pick up the token we are trying to avoid doing that or reloading the page and stuff so what i'm trying to fix is just so that after you have signed it successfully which it has already done when you click here again it doesn't bring this up so that's what i'm trying to fix so once i fix this then i'll just i'll do it\n",
       "(21:33): Inferno Eagle:  i don't know if you got that yeah yeah i got i got that i don't know if you got that yeah yeah i got i got that i'm just thinking what's the point i'm just thinking what's the point to not publish and whatever we have now because it will to not publish and whatever we have now because it will take it could take time to get verified\n",
       "(21:40): Fierce Vulture:  That's to the Chrome Web Store, right?\n",
       "(21:41): Inferno Eagle:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n",
       "(21:44): Fierce Vulture:  Oh, I was thinking of to Confluence.\n",
       "(21:46): Abyssal Rogue:  No, no, no, yeah.\n",
       "(21:50): Abyssal Rogue:  Just take the work and build and then publish it in...\n",
       "(22:06): Inferno Eagle:  we can publish now actually yeah yeah yeah just um we can publish we can publish now actually yeah yeah yeah just um we can publish like just the last build right like just the last build right yes yes definitely definitely yes okay um okay let me yes yes definitely definitely yes okay um okay let me handle this and"
