And then just like taking all of that into account, like doing a deep dive into the target audience and then putting together a content content plan and executing on that content plan with our content team over like a 30 60 90 day period and obviously beyond that but that's that's what we would start with yeah and like I guess also the goal on top of what Phil said would be to like, you know, we want to actually learn, you know, everything there is to learn about our customers and do the best job we can.  The way we, you know, do that is, you know, just by making it more quality over quality, I guess you could say.  So like, yeah, you know, just really like making it a collaborative process, you know, And being able to share their ideas, but also just like really creating a specific catered plan 30 60 90.

What's the one that Nate uses for the meeting? I don't know which one he uses, but I've used Fireflies, and then let me see what else I've used.  I'm gonna try and look up the one he uses.  I have not actually stuck with one yet personally, but I've tried a couple of different ones.  I like use, yeah, I personally use it for myself rather than sending it to other- Oh, TLDV.  Okay.  in Otter AI is another one that I've tried.  Oh, that's the one, Otter AI, yeah.  Okay.\n",

Dmitry shares his personal experience with summarizing calls for his older partner, highlighting the limited use he finds for the tool, which is primarily for recalling general ideas from meetings.\n",
       "  > AI Marketing Directory:  literally only one specific i started doing it for one reason because our third partner um is an older guy and he uh he you know sometimes when i like talk to him about calls that i have a little summary so I literally you know if he asked me I'll pull it up but but that's pretty much the only use I found for it so far you've been reporting with was this  so you've been creating reports about your communities with with the other partner  no no so like i summarize my i don't use it for like you know sometimes You know, like I, I do it for, you know, I summarize like a call that I had, I'll put it, you know, in like a Google drive document and like, you know, if, if my, if the other partner asks us about it, I'll pull it up on my phone.

       "  > AI Marketing Directory:  So I guess maybe the next step for us might be, you know, like i said we're crafting a new landing page but we could send you we pretty much have it all we know what we're what it's going what's going to be on it and everything so we could send you an email um you know with you know, all the, all the information, and we can maybe, you know, you can let us know how you feel about that, and I guess, you know, in light of your situation, you know, we'll, we'll, you know, we'll see, um, like, but, um, like, what we can deal with with respect to that um so does that sound good to you yeah sure um all right and then yeah sorry we're gonna say no i was gonna say yeah we could just send over an email with what our offer is and kind of how we think it would work well for BEXA and you personally, especially if you're trying to grow your personal brand along with BEXA.  Because obviously, that's going to help.  So yeah, we'll send over all the details, and then.  MARIUSZ GASIEWSKI, But can you share with me the idea?\n",

Any like industry news that you want to touch on like those kind of things. And then, like come up with a content plan based on our conversations for like the next two weeks and then we just kind of do it all over again yeah I feel like as of May\n",

       "  > AI Marketing Directory:  Yeah, that's why we would want to be in constant communication with anyone we're working with because we're not in the day-to-day.  So getting those updates makes it super simple.  And then also just like if we're managing, a personal brand, what are the types of content that they want created?  What are the topics that they want?  What are the stories they want to tell?\n",
       "- [25:19] This chunk is part of a conversation between representatives of AI Marketing Directory and Dmitry Grankin, discussing their new approach to content creation for founder-led companies. It highlights their expertise in crafting viral content and leveraging an influencer network, emphasizing the importance of both content creation and distribution strategies in their marketing efforts.\n",
       "  > AI Marketing Directory:  And we could just, we just have the knowledge and skill set to put that together in a way that has like viral potential yeah and two things i want to say uh echoing phil's point yeah like one that's like the common problem we're finding is like you know all these founders they have great ideas obviously for other starting companies.  But like Phil said, like, you know, we have the knowledge and expertise to not only put it together in a way that's well, but quickly.  And the second thing is like, you know, we're also gonna be utilizing our, influencer network that we've been aggregating.  Part of the reason we're targeting Twitter first and not LinkedIn right now is not just because we have probably more knowledge of Twitter, but we've been aggregating a huge influencer network for a long time.  know, um, you know, and we we pay for that exposure out of our pockets. So we take care of that, you know, so there are elements of distribution and elements of creation involved in it. So, you know, it's it's not\n"
