She shares her thoughts on the startup's email marketing approach, her interview with the founders, and her concerns about the advisory role and contract terms. The conversation also touches on the dynamics of startup investments and the lack of depth in some entrepreneurial communities.\n",
       "  > Tatiana Sukhova:  Да, я могу тебе в двух словах сказать, у нас здесь есть один знакомый инвестор Сергей Богданов, ты его знаешь, он у нас так просто друг уже в целом, ну не друг, но знакомый хороший.  и он мне один раз написал типа тут стартап хотим проинвестировать посмотри презентаж Там получается email-маркетинг для нового поколения с кучей всяких автоматизаций, типа автоматические сегменты, audience segments и все это такое.  Все это получается, ну, на дейте завязано.  И у меня достаточно мощное пересечение опытов от моих последних.  Я же на дейте-платформе провела последние полтора года, а для этого мы учили 4 года.  То есть, понимаешь, да?  Ну, я ему там рассказала все, что я думала по поводу этой презентации.  Причем сказала, я старалась так балансировать.  То есть, я сказала, что это молодежь калифорнийская, которая вообще что-то тут по фану поделала.  На меня нет вообще уверенности, что они что-то смогут.  С другой стороны, говорю, я чувствую свежую энергию, я чувствую, что они как бы могут знать того, что мы даже не подумаем уже в нашем предприятии.  им надо помогать. Ну и там по Data Source кучу вопросов она задавала. В общем, проявила себя как человек экспертный в этом. Он меня пригласил с ними пособеседоваться, Хотя для меня они не адвайзеры.  Я с ними поговорила, мне не очень понравилось, как прошло это собеседование, потому что два каких-то сосунка, 20-летних, 20-25, меня как будто вообще насыщали.  ...собеседовали на роль продакт-дизайнера.  А я в конце им сказала, ребятушки, я тут как бы не ищу себе работу продакт-дизайнером у вас.  Вот. Но при этом я им так понравилась, как выяснилось позже.  что они сказали, о, да, все, хотим, адвайзером.  Это преседу с оксидом.  Преседу с оксидом, да.  А эти ребятки, они подняли уже 600 тысяч, то есть они входили со своими...  200 на момент, когда те уже 600 подняли, а цель у них 1,5 миллиона была.  То есть фрагментов.  И они дают кэш в 150, а 50 дают в виде услуг.  вайзеринге вайс услуг вайзер услуг услуги легал там в общем в самом вайзере и вот я выяснилось, что он позвонил за каких-то два других, таких же Сергея Богдановых с другими именами, вообще один в один просто.  И оказывается, что я вообще должна войти в их пул адвайзеров ну то есть что это такая конвейерная работа как акселерацию знаешь вот они прислали контракт который мне очень понравился В плане, что там какие-то странные вообще вещи, что ты, типа, если ты не оказал услугу, то ты торчишь 50 баксов.  Потому что ты знаешь, какие-то вообще вещи, детский сад какой-то вообще.  И мы сейчас с Вадиком думаем.  Я решила подумать вообще.  надо мне это или нет, потому что мы хотим от тебя непонятно что, мы не можем тебе вообще не гарантировать, не каких-то там, даже сказать, какие объемы от тебя потребуются и в какие сроки.  покажи что ты торчишь 50 баксов ну то есть как это знаешь мне настолько сильно это надо чтобы вот я сейчас подумаю хотя подвести их тоже не хочется короче у меня есть есть чем позаниматься и помимо этого вот поэтому я поторопилась сказать что я вхожу это фигню возможно я в нее еще не буду ходить на вот буквально шесть  Сейчас вот все происходит онлайн.  Ну, окей, интересно тоже информация с разных источников про одно и то же, потому что это же все наша Лиссабонская тусовка.  очень активный чувак и они просто услуг просто оказывают в комьюнити  но они странные какие-то услуги оказывают знаешь хотя вроде чуваки на Чуть встретишься, чуть глубже как-то начнёшь и понимаешь, что там глубины вообще нет.  То есть там чисто инвестиции, они ничего ни в чём не понимают, они просто циферки, иксы, иксы, иксы.  а при этом привозят вот на этот мастер майнс тысяч долларов в месяц занимаются я  Там эти регаты, тусовки, там по 80 евро собрали людей во время санкций.  там чем-то немножко покормили кальян и поставили окей я вообще не против все нормально глубины нет в силу того что Она там не предполагается. Я когда Antler проходил, я тоже очень удивился, что я как технический фаундер, как бы мои квалификации, вообще что я думаю.\n",

       "  > Dmitry Grankin:  с инфлюенсерами у нас как раз есть хорошая история и там нанимал девочку бразильянку искал инфлюенсеров одного микро инфлюенсер у него там 3000 подписчиков он записал один видосик и оттуда каждый день идут пользователи уже на протяжении двух месяцев Нет проблем с трафиком с инфлюенсерами.  Есть проблемы с целевым трафиком с инфлюенсерами.  Но они пользуются.  А, пользуются.  Они пользуются, каждый день потом пользуются.  Слушай, если идет трафик с инфлюенсеров, тогда реально, может быть, идти в сторону инфлюенсеров.  Да, и потом видишь, у меня какие шансы были обратиться к той или иной.  Они по-английски не говорят, он по-английски не говорит. Я не могу с ним даже переписываться, он так по-английски пишет, что его понять невозможно, что он хочет сказать.  Вот, то есть прямо история, которая прямо кажется, что ее надо масштабировать.  Много появляется платформ для работы с инфлюенсерами.  Там, наверное, вопрос скорее цены, чтобы сходил с юнит-экономикой, что возврат инвестиций будет.  Да.\n",

       "  > Dmitry Grankin:  но там я 200 евро потратил это он кстати бесплатно сделал он получил год бесплатного использует последний Вот, и да, наверное, вот это да, наверное, нужно делать в первую очередь, ну вот, а разработку, да, вот вести, исходя из того, а что привлечет больше пользователей, вот.  давайте вопрос я делаю разработка что даст сетевой эффект из этого из того что делаешь ну вот и чисто ориентироваться на то что что обратку тебя отвечают пользователи. Больше ничего больше не надо делать.  И даже с инвесторами не разговаривать.  Сами придут.  Да, хороший план.  Значит, как план?  Вообще я вижу много разных способов того, как люди привлекают трафик к себе, но они все контентные, к сожалению.  То есть я даже не могу ничего посоветовать хорошего.  Ну, то есть, как пример.  Есть ребята, которые делают какой-то контент в Twitter, в Blue Sky.  в LinkedIn, где рассказывают о том, как они показывают, как они что-то разработали, и там чисто на красоту. То есть они просто показывают какую-то новую фичу, скорее всего, даже не фичу, какую-то мелочь, которую они добавили.  И просто делают это каждый То есть, очевидно, они нанимают какого-то разработчика, который занимается только какой-то привлекательной частью продукта и шарит просто какие-то мелочи.  Есть ребята, которые покупают...  маленькие продукты.  Вот это, кстати, очень любопытная гипотеза, но есть ребята, которые покупают у инди-хакеров продукты, которые Пишут, что они их сделали, как бы собирая портфель этих микропродуктов.  На самом деле все эти микропродукты просто это как контентный маркетинг, и они пиарят его как личный бренд и его продукт.  выдвигая его вперед и любопытно что таких становится все больше и больше тоже как вариант но это мне кажется смежно с тем что ты рассказал про сел тулы Да, про микросарс, про селтулы.\n",

У тебя весь этот нетворк сохраняется, ты что-то там придумал, стал поставить.  старше, поопытней, и делаешь уже с бэкграундом успешного SEO-шника.  Вот, и для меня это ценно.  Вот такая идея. И я предлагаю пожертвовать R'n'B темой.  Давай, конечно, ее проработаем.  О, кайф.  Я просто с технической точки зрения...  С моей точки зрения, уверен, что с той штукой, о которой мы стали познакомиться, это мало общего будет на самом деле.  я тоже так вижу но для меня это было отправной точкой типа за что зацепиться на то есть типа все инвестируют в и и И я не думаю, что много кто уже делал нечто подобное, так что why not, почему не попробовать, не знаю, люди купят все, что угодно, все, чтобы...

И после этого уже Можно идти, ну вот в принципе вот и с этим, наверное, можно.  Потому что вот такие штуки, их можно сделать руками, это будет стоить.  условно-бесплатно, потому что ты можешь сделать руками.  Ну да, да, чипите что-то, она генерирует спокойненько.  Прикольно, прикольно, но...  Но, опять же, для преза нужно какое-то...  Вот я давай поширю, наверное, как это оформил Челик.  Я ему как раз комментировал, он сегодня обновил.  И забавно, что у него тоже фамилия Горячев.  Мы на первую встречу пришли, и такие, лол, встретились.  Так, вот сейчас.  Вот это вот...  У него проект называется MyCraftMate, что-то такое.

Бот помогает им цели декомпозировать как-то, их достигать, и вот это вот все.  Ну, и опять же, просто для примерчика, как это оформляется.  так куда смотреть на просто телегу да но это можешь презенташку глянуть Ну, понятно, да.  Да, ну, typical.  Но, соответственно, для этого нужна какая-то мейн-идея продукта.  Что это? ПК для меня это и ассистент, и опять же, это то, что им надо.  То есть видишь, такая идея как раз висит в списке идей SKL.  И ассистент для Digital Nomads, да, но что он делает, этот и ассистент, вот так вот.  Какая проблема у Digital Nomads есть, которую ты...  Ассистент решает.  Ну вот я бы начал  с keyword research и пришел бы к Каким-то гипотезам на эту тему.  Давай прямо это сделаем.  Я посмотрю Wordstat, посмотри по GPT.  Ай, чё там в Яксо думают?  Нужна тайна.  create a list of related keywords 50 at the Должен же быть какой-то use case для реал тайма.  Uh-huh.  А почему по-русски?  Они все русскоязычные.

Language Translation очень понятно.  Локал нетворкинг. Прикольно.  Так...  Ну да, вот это интересно.  Интересная наборка имвардов.  Тут еще Research от обычно Reddit на эту тему.  да там я видел даже штуки по фабрика контента и там будет идет смотреть топовые запросы в Вопросы в Reddit, готовят под них сценарии, готовят под них видос с озвучкой и заливают на YouTube.

       "  > Dmitry Grankin:  I had a few campaigns, let's say, like we had LinkedIn outreach campaign this summer then we had product hunt release and we had a Brazilian influencer integration and yeah it looks like all these things are working uh and for now i don't Don't take any marketing effort rather than speaking to you and to my immediate network.  uh for because i've been busy building the product the last few weeks and now the product is live in the dashboard the the the thing that we're having after the meeting is we've been rebuilt in heaven it's difficult to do all the also  marketing and sales if your founder working on the product right and In the meantime, you also need customers, but you have to do a little bit of everything.  Yes, but the thing is that you basically, You cannot...  These things are really difficult to...  to hire someone to do for you i had a product manager and the thing was that we've been you know speaking with your for a couple of hours daily and this is a sunk time cost right these two hours and and she was talking to people and obviously i lose a lot of information while she speaks to people not me so basically I lose money to pay her her job I lose information because she is doing these things and I lose time when trying to communicate with here and same thing happens with the development team as well So the thing is that you'd better do everything yourself if you could, and to delegate things that are quite specific quite specific so this product who you were working with product manager  but she was working with the product maybe talking to some people but she was not doing a marketing or sales for you she's been doing marketing as well but she's  working as product manager, then we switched, she started doing marketing, but she was not me, you know.  And I don't say I'm better than you in all the ways, but the thing is that I am the founder and as a founder, you basically need to probably delegate things that you already know by hand you know things that that there There is something you understand what you want to achieve from this or that specific tool or mechanism.  Um, yeah, that's why for now I'd rather work with professionals who know specific like marketing mechanism.  who know how to whatever they're a good like a good experience was working with it with the girl who delivered this Brazilian influencer integration because this guy doesn't speak English at all.  I have no choice to address that audience because I don't speak their language, I don't share their mindset.  and i even can't communicate with this guy because we have their direct connection but we just don't understand each other i'd better speak uh portuguese with him try to speak rather than he would speak english to me because so these things really work so she she's she's done a job I couldn't deliver at all yeah yeah there's a different ways of marketing of course influencer  The marketing now is working pretty well, but of course you need to move with on the right audience, you know, you have to know who are your ideal customers that you your solution and then basically just engage with this segment in the market how does the sales if you're a super early stage company like you it's ideal that you can have conversations with like potential customers right um that you are like the the the the the first person like to talk to you know because you know your company best and the product and everything but always a challenge with the founders I see is that, yeah, they have to do so many things so they don't have time for sales and they do a little bit of sales or then they hire an agency to do it for them, but then, There's never the results that you pay for.  So actually you want to do it yourself, but also you don't have time to do it yourself.\n",

       "  > Jasper Vanuytrecht:  Yes, I think for sure. I mean, I see the product you did the demo and it looks really good. You know, it's like I was impressed. I'm sure you can sell this.  I think it's just a matter of knowing who needs the solution most, who has this problem that you solve.  So this is all like strategy and this is the basis for the good sales go to market.  Once you have that, you can find for instance you can think about a really good message like when you do send an email or you send a LinkedIn message to this perfect client you know what What you always have to say is like, you make like a personal observation about them that is relevant to a certain business problem that they are struggling with.  So it will be immediately it gets their attention and then you basically say that you solve this in this way without really pitching your in your company you know so how you solve this and in the in the third part of the message if you can also convey why you are better than competition for this specific customer this is also really compelling for them so they know okay they are better than grain because this isn't isn't this or they better than fireflies because of this you know for us that's why you're are unique and then lastly you do call to action so you offer them something really interesting so they will take an action or is maybe meeting with you or is trying the product free trial or maybe downloads whatever kind of a marketing piece you know and this is how you can auto this this works you automate it consistently you're getting leads leads and customers and this will obviously help you grow and get you to the series b yeah uh i think um there is a uh  Establishing a establishing market for these kind of tools.  So there is something that obviously has got demand and the problem the problem is people just want to to store the information basically store they even don't don't need that much to access it sometimes but they want to want to store it as a matter of fact and so there is a market and there is is a problem and for enterprises is a problem they can't use it because of their own privacy and security policy.  In order to work on this, the solution is to have this thing deployed locally in premises.  And then the vision of the product comes in, which is...  You build knowledge while speaking to customers and team members and not only you about the entire company and those who need this knowledge most have instant access to it it's like everybody is contributing to just by doing the things that they naturally do, just speaking to people, pitching their ideas.  And why is that cool?  is that people tend to naturally share more while verbally you know on meetings and come up with more creative things to to deliver there to share uh to share the things and you have it for for basically you like uh You have it for free in a chat interface.  Same thing as you would have with ChatGPTO or publicly available.  data you have something for your own gated knowledge which is much much more  valuable\n",

       "  > Jasper Vanuytrecht:  That's, I think, important to mention also in every conversation with such a client, you know, and so in the outreach messages, So, yeah, I think Yeah, and then  Sorry, yeah, just dropped Then comes obviously comes use cases And the slot of use cases use cases which we don't have a good understanding which like marketing research like you can can make it like one from marketing research who are competitors what people say about this company about this product performance All of our team members are more into this and that technology, this and that idea.  about crypto or whatever yeah yeah well if  again like if you're planning to do the sales yourself you're not going to hire like a lead generation agency you're not going to like hire salespeople like it's very expensive like you know the salaries you know sales commission or especially the lead generation agencies they charge maybe every month for okay so if you want to have like better like a strategy that you can do the sales but in a very effective way, I can help you with that. And my offer is very, it's very simple. So I always work with business owners, like one session per week of more or less two hours we do four to five sessions so it's like more or less one month and with all this you You will get the strategy and you know exactly which tools you can use to generate new clients, you know.  And during all this time, I'm like your, support you know um you can always ask me questions i will help it's not just like sessions or workshop sessions but i can help you on the go you have we have like collaborative documents uh we have the slides we have yeah help with the implementation execution of everything so all this together um to give you an idea of what it what it might cost if you're if you're interested um it ranges uh so the various the minimum it's like 2k the maximum is 5k so the bigger companies they more or less but about 5k they usually need more sessions so it's The amount of session that defines it, but you can, you can do it for.  For the lower ends of the, of the range to, to give you an idea.  I tried the same thing where I had one session with a friend of mine about this was the same concept. It didn't work just because I just didn't have time for implementation, just didn't have resources. Basically that Yeah, that's it, and I went building the product.  Yeah.  So...  it might happen is that I feel like at some point in time, if I feel like I'm dedicated to it right now for, Yeah, or a week or two and then go for it.

But of course, when you learn something, you learn a strategy as a founder.  you have to really execute it you know you have to take action because if you're not going to do anything of sales and marketing or in some point you're investments they you have less runway at some point so you need customers this is also always saying start new cooperation like look this project success depends 50 on you also it's not not 100 on me as the trainer you know because if you do not execute what i teach you or what we learn this is not it's going to have zero value for you because you will not get any sales from it you know so this is of course very important aspect of this kind of cooperation but when they do when they when they work you see immediately like within a few weeks after completing program even sometimes during the program they start between the workshops they already start executing everything everything they learn they're already generating the leads and they book like twice as much meetings with potential clients every week so this is what we What we want to see is results with the clients that they have more meetings, more sales opportunities.  But yeah, often it's really a matter.  of the knowledge you know and the strategy and yeah i i i did like 10 years only doing focusing on that you know So it's so much testing, trial and error, all this knowledge, all this time.  You can download this, you know, in one month and then you have all the knowledge.  that you can use to to be successful that's the that is the the goal yeah  Okay, I think at some point when I got to the The idea I need to do the outreach and start digging into it.

       "  > Dmitry Grankin:  SEO tools, like people as of SEO, I mean, SEO, search engine optimization. When people say about SEO, they usually mean like a kind of an article or text but it does not have to be like that it could be a tool yeah that is that is solving some kind of common problem free easy and um like for example my competitor what they've done is that they they have been acquiring I'm acquiring traffic by just get YouTube transcript, which is basically, you have this YouTube transcript.  It's available over API.  It's a very simple thing, but users, people tend to search for this.  thing on youtube so they had a few uh youtube videos like that and uh acquiring traffic uh having a landing page delivering this transcript which is easily available to them and then converting some of these guys to their tool which is about acquiring transcripts from Google Meet.

       "- [08:30] This chunk occurs during a conversation between Waqas Arshad and Dmitry Grankin, where Waqas discusses the importance of SEO and content marketing for Dmitry's product, which is currently in beta testing. He compares Dmitry's product to competitors like Otter and Firefly, emphasizing the need for a blog section that addresses user queries to enhance conversion rates.\n",
       "  > Waqas Arshad:  So as you know, you are actually launching your product, you are beta testing it right now.  People are getting traction and obviously from product and we can see that people are actually giving good reviews about the product.  So that actually shows that your market fit right now.  So once you go towards the launch, you should actually start working on your SEO and SEO should be focused towards your content marketing.  your blog section.  So what I have to say about your SEO, I mean, the main reason I reached out to you as well was, if you have seen your main competitors like Otter or Five Flies, Just I would like to know, do you consider Otter or Firefly as your competitor, or do you have some other competitors that you think are more relevant, if you can name them to me?  Yeah, we've got Otter, Firefly, We've got Fathom, we've got ETLGB, and these are the main competitors.  Okay, so while doing my head  I went on to Fireflies and Autumn.  So if you actually go onto the website and you did a little exploration on the website, you will see that both of them have a specific blog section on your website. And if you actually go a little bit deeper and see what type of content they're actually writing on the website. So that's not just an informational content that they write, their main goal and their main purpose.  was for having a block section is to address the queries and address the problem their users are having so that they can actually convert and start using the product, right?\n",
       "- [10:06] In a conversation between Waqas Arshad and Dmitry Grankin about the marketing strategies for a new AI transcription tool, Waqas emphasizes the importance of product-led SEO as a long-term strategy to attract users by addressing their specific problems, contrasting it with short-term tactics like PPC and influencer marketing.\n",
       "  > Waqas Arshad:  So we call it as a product led SEO.  SEO so that focuses on writing content for the users who are actually looking for the product who are having a problem in actually getting transcriptions or recording of the meeting or AI based speech recognition and the transcription of the meeting notes.  So these kinds of problems.  So they are actually writing topics, covering those problems and giving their product The solution, so that when someone comes and reads that content piece, first of all, they'll find the solution to the problem and then they will naturally see that, okay, VEXA AI actually solved my problem, okay, let me try it out.  So it will be acting as a natural lead magnet for you, right?  So it's a long-term thing.  You definitely need to work on that as your competitors are also doing.  And if you don't go towards SEO and you just focus on Captera, GE2 or PPC or influencer marketer, obviously you'll get quick results, you will get short term results, you will get short term leads, but in the longer run, And whenever you stop paying them, your traffic would fall down and you'll not be having a steady inflow of users onto your website.  So cutting it short, it should be a very balanced approach where you should focus on SEO as well as you should build a short-term strategy, let it be PPC, let it be influencer marketing, let it be other platforms like G2 Capital. So I'm not saying don't go that way.  But it has to be a balanced approach.  So you take both of these side by side so that one chunking is going toward a short-term goal and then one chunk is going towards a long-term plan.\n",
       "- [13:07] This chunk is part of a conversation between Waqas Arshad and Dmitry Grankin, where Waqas discusses strategies for content creation and SEO specifically tailored for SaaS companies. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the product's value propositions and target audience (ICP) to effectively select topics for blog content. The dialogue also explores the significance of generating leads through relevant content rather than just focusing on traffic, and it outlines a structured approach to content marketing that includes different stages of the buyer's journey.\n",
       "  > Waqas Arshad:  this concept so this is the main thing that i would like you to actually explore and this is what we are specializing in so we work with SaaS companies like you and we help you then manage their blog section so it's not just uh seeing what your competitor is doing pick up the topic put that into the ai tool generate the content and publish so it's not how this works Very specialized thing that needs to be done with the specific understanding where your product stands, what are your value propositions, what is your ICP, and then based upon that, we do the topic selection.  and then once topic is selected then content is crafted with proper in-depth competitor analysis right so this is a complete process that we take and we help our SaaS clients managing the blog section.  So is this something that you think you would like to explore?  Is this something you would like to go towards?  Yes, yes, I'll be doing that.  That's for sure.  I'll be doing that, but my vision is that text is something that can be and should be done and everybody is making these pages a blog.  But also there is something that is an idea of micro-SaaS or SEO tools, is that something You create a service that is related to your main product, which is coming from something that people are...  searching for life.  Can you, I actually couldn't get your point here.  Can you please repeat that for me?  Yes, I mean that it's like the,  example is like tactic is getting a traffic from YouTube for how to get transcripts from you How to get transcripts from YouTube is something that you can get this transcript just from a single API call.  So they are just delivering this value instead of writing a blog post.  They are just giving this transcript.  to the user and they use a combination of contact marketing, influence marketing, just saying, hey, you need this YouTube transcripts here is how to get them all six attached just go and visit this page and get your transcripts that's it and it's generating traffic which is a candle related possibly related to what they've been delivering as a main product it's always converting yeah there is uh i now get your point so what you're saying  Suggesting is we focus on topics that we can also made a YouTube video on.  So we build a video on YouTube and then the traffic that comes from that particular video, we Redirected to our page on the website, right? That's what you were telling.  Yeah, I mean something that there is a lot of related things like how to transcribe a video, how to transcribe an audio, how to how to summarize YouTube video, whatever.  A lot of things that are related and you can basically just land them to the uh you know to the portal as a result with this content so well uh  i now understand your point dimitri the point here is there can be endless possibilities on what we can do right but in order to give you a little direction what's what would be the main starting point is first of all We will have to actually understand the main features that what your product is actually providing. So we'll list those main features that okay, these are the main problems that your product is solving. These are the main key features that your product is having right now.  So we'll prepare a list for that.  Then we'll be creating an ICP.  So we'll have a discussion with you and we'll figure out what is your main target ICP. So what are your main prospects look like?  Once we have that information, then we'll be actually figuring out the topics that are actually related to your ICP and to your features.  So if we go that way, the selection of topic would be very much relevant to your product first thing and then it will be actually addressing the problems your ict is having so right now the suggestion that you're giving me it can be related to your product or maybe it's totally irrelevant So once we have done this activity and then the selection of topic is done, only then we can make sure that the people who are landing onto your website are actually interested in the product.  Otherwise there are endless possibilities the topics that we can write on and it doesn't give you any results so at the end of the day any content piece that you write any video that you create the main goal is to actually generate leads is actually to find people who are actually by the product, right?  So the main goal is not getting traffic.  So let's say you have 1 million traffic on the website and no one is converting, it's of no use to you.  But if you have 10,000 highly targeted people landing onto your website and which are actually converting that is more relevant to you so selection of the keyword is very important it's it's just the one approach uh which is yeah  yes which is basically to to find a traffic that will convert to a specific product uh the other one is more like in search for a value proposition given the technology stack and the thing that not the uh value proposition we are having now but something that product could potentially do like the uh the technology and the starting backward starting from what people are actually searching for yeah exactly there are  basically three categories of the contents a large amount of trust  from there and trying to acquire this traffic and see how to actually convert it into sales with the technology we have.  Because the technology can be repositioned in a myriad of ways.  And I would also be interested to explore this approach as well, starting backwards.  what people are actually searching related to potentially the technology stack i am having  yeah so basically let me give you a little bit more idea about how these things work so there are three Major categories of the content that we work on so top of the funnel middle of the funnel and the bottom of the funnel topics so top of the funnel are the topics which are actually providing information about the product so maybe.  How does meeting assistant works?  What is meeting assistant, how to proscribe, how to do the transcription, these kinds of informative topics, then there are bottle on the bottom of the funding here are the bottom of the middle of the funnel are the people who are actually a little more towards the buyer journey.  So they do know about the product, they do know about the problem, they are exploring the bottom of the funnel. These are the keywords which are commercial in nature. So these are the keywords where people are actually planning to make a decision. They are they are a purchase right so it will be a complete combination of these three type of topics so top of the funnel informative pieces but middle of the funnel and then the bottom of the funnel so it will be a complete mix so it's not just one type of topics, those will be the queries that are informative, then decision making, and then the final commercial topics as well.  So it can be a complete combination of that.  I understand this concept.  OK, yes.\n",
       "- [36:01] This chunk is part of a conversation between Waqas Arshad and Dmitry Grankin, where Waqas provides strategic advice on content marketing for Dmitry's SaaS product. He emphasizes the importance of focusing on high-quality content over quantity, discusses the relevance of targeted traffic in the SaaS industry, and suggests conducting trials with different content creation agencies to evaluate effectiveness and pricing.\n",
       "  > Waqas Arshad:  So my suggestion to you would be just focus on quality content content if you don't have budget for like four articles of a month just do two if you don't have budget for two just do one it should be high quality don't go towards quantity don't go towards cheap seo i would say Search for the market leaders in the SEO and see what they have to say.  Traffic is just a vanity these days.  People, especially in the SaaS industry, they're not looking for traffic.  They say, we don't want traffic on our website.  We only want people who want our product because that's the main goal.  We are here to sell.  We are not here to give any public service and they're not running ads or they are not doing any affiliate marketing on the website.  So any traffic is not relevant.  they only want people who are interested so that's a very important thing that you need to consider and from my side i would i can only say before you opt you can try I on a free or on a trial with us.  And one trial with me, one trial with any other chief agency, do a benchmark on maybe as you are aware of AI, you can produce one content on your own using AI and see what's the difference, which one performs better.  And then only then you can actually figure out of the pricing that I'm quoting  is actually, uh, expensive or is it cost effective?  So, uh, I'll share some case studies with you that.  have published you can have a look upon what our customers have seen and then maybe at that point  you can decide if it's something that you would like to buy or not okay thank you very much  with me your uh yeah the portfolio the things that you want to share with  yeah sure thing i'll drop it after the call on your linkedin chat and  i'll be looking forward to your response okay thank you very much have a nice day\n",

So I brought a few that I thought about.  And so the first one would be a training Feedback for communication, so for example, people that are coaches, career coaches, you know, that they can use VEXA for their clients.  when they are in coaching their clients really, and then they can use a transcription to analyze how the person communicates during the meetings, look for, patterns and their communication as, for example, if they use some kind of excessive terms or if they interrupt sometimes how efficient the message is that they are transcribing and then sorry okay okay yeah go ahead and then add the social media that i would focus for this specific The specific target would be LinkedIn and Instagram.

So there is a few companies that do qualitative research So they have to make interviews and that is also a really good way of using VEXA because then they can have the transcription, and lots of times when you use a when you do qualitative research you make a recording that you have to listen to over and over again so vexa would do a very good way to to not have to go through the recording again you would just have to go through the transcription and then analyze it so a few quality  search you mean uh what what's the you you mean uh those guys who are listening to conversations by by other people yeah like yeah like uh like specialized marketing companies that's  specialized in research for other companies.\n",

Именно в том, что я тоже...  Почему я занимался бизнесом так, как я им занимался?  Вот в таком бутиковом формате.  У меня был бизнес, когда у меня было много продюсеров.  и так далее.  Потом я это все уволил, всех остался один.  Почему?  Потому что мне нравилось делать то, что я делаю самому.\n",

She highlights the lack of user engagement and the importance of analyzing user registration and usage statistics to improve onboarding effectiveness, while also identifying traffic as a critical issue that has not been adequately addressed.\n",
       "  > Viktoria Kharlamova:  То есть правильно я понимаю, что все-таки, ну то есть из проблем, которые, по крайней мере, я вижу, Вот эта история с тем, что буду доупаковать продукт и анбординг, чтобы подготовить его, чтобы была возможность продавать с точки зрения грамотной бизнес-модели.  Вот, или, ну, то есть мне хочется просто немножко понять больше из твоих ожиданий, с чем нужна помощь.  Да, да, да, вот я еще чуть закончу.  Вот этого товарища я...  слышал не видел не знаю кто он и он не хочет со мной общаться то есть как бы есть пользователи с которыми нет никакой как бы личной связи и никакие Никакого личного внимания, которое давно пользуется и регулярно, что есть, на мой взгляд, хороший сигнал.  Да, что я думаю, ну вот если взять новые, значит, регистрации, вот новые регистрации, Вчера было три новых регистрации, ни одного использования. Вот это для меня показатель того, что либо анбординг не пройден, либо у них не было еще встречи.  одно из двух вот дальше мы смотрим что было использование два раза использовали Здесь, наверное, надо вывести нормальную какую-то статистику из этого, для того, чтобы понять эффективность онбординга. Но, на мой взгляд, очевидно, что узкое место в трафике.  Потому что трафиком никто ни в каком серьезном виде не занимался вообще, это все какие-то непонятные люди без UTM-ок.  И тенем, кем мы трачим, но они все прямые.\n",

       "  > Viktoria Kharlamova:  Тут смотри, наверное, сразу же скажу, что я фокусируюсь на анбординге и монетизации, то есть то, что касается трафика.  с этим я помочь точно не смогу.  Вот, то есть это не моя специальность.  Вот, моя история — это про анбординг и про монетизацию.  Вот, я поэтому...  Самое важное, на мой взгляд, что важно понять, это то, где ты видишь ключевую проблему и насколько я реально могу с этим помочь.  Вот. То есть насколько, я не знаю, насколько...  Сейчас я понимаю, что анбординг, он вообще для всех и всегда является проблемой, вот.  Но я тут скорее про то, что если ты видишь еще проблему в трафике, то тут опять же, если у вас кто-то, кто этим фокусно занимается, либо, ну, вы планируете  менять человека сушину узкое место очевидно в трафике но вы до онбординг монетизация монетизация давай давай с этой позиции продолжим дальнейший разговор тогда  Ну да, смотри, то есть...  Важно, да, безусловно.\n",

       "  > Viktoria Kharlamova:  Ну, я бы сказала, начинать точно с отбординга, вот, а остальное уже просто чуть попозже.  Окей.  Вот, по формату примерно так.  Как ты видишь построение этого процесса?  Слушай, тут на самом деле я супергибкая, то есть мой формат работы — это консультации.  Обычно это раз в неделю часовые консультации, которые, соответственно, команда...  Обычно не больше двух человек, ну, мне кажется, это как раз-таки тот формат, когда, не знаю, это можно назвать дизайнером, я думаю, что даже нужно 100%.  Вот, вы готовите свои вопросы, вот, я...  Отдельным пакетом услуг у меня идет анализ флоу, но мне кажется, что вам это не нужно, потому что, ну, типа, флоу не такое большое, и, скорее всего, это можно будет разобрать просто на консультации и вырассказать.  скажите, какие исследования вы проводили, что делали и так далее.  Вот, и мы с вами это все проанализируем и посмотрим, и вы начнете улучшать определенные вещи, исходя из моего фидбэка, плюс исходя из правильных исследований.  Вот, то же самое касается монетизации, ну, то есть это вы приходите с какими-то своими гипотезами, потому что вы, в принципе, понимаете, что у вас за пользователи и потенциально каким...  Есть какая-то информация о том, каким образом они могут вам платить, вот, и мы с вами это тоже обсуждаем, вот, и, соответственно, потом вы это имплементите поэтапно, сначала, я говорю, онбординг, на мой взгляд, это первая история, потом...  включается трафик и там после трафика либо во время монетизация я думаю что на самом деле монетизацию не стоит сильно откладывать потому что ну логично без  вопрос просто как ее реализовать технически нет никаких проблем хотя бы фейк-пэймент какой-то будет иметь, понимаешь?  Ага.  Да, да, да.\n",

       "  > Viktoria Kharlamova:  Вот, по формату работы, вот как я сказала, это часовые сессии, то есть в вашей ситуации, я думаю, что...  обычно беру с 10 из 20 часов но честно я не уверена что при текущей стадии у вас будет вопросов на 20 часов вот поэтому я могу предложить 10 часов то есть вы покупаете ретейнер и мы их за определенное время, ну, то есть надо подумать, 10 часов – это обычно 2 месяца, если раз в неделю, примерно 2,5, вот, вы их тратите, вот, и мы с вами все вот эти вопросы обсуждаем.  И вы, соответственно, после каждой сессии имплементируете анбординг и другие штуки, монетизацию и прочее.  А какая часовая ставка?  400 евро. Часовая ставка. Вот. И получается, что вы готовите вопросы заранее, скидываете.  Обычно я прошу за сутки скидывать, чтобы я посмотрела, вчиталась и уже начала об этом думать.  Потому что, честно, я вот поработала уже с 40 компаниями.  И лучших результатов мы достигли с теми, кто реально готовится и скидывает.  Вот это прям ужасно значимо стало.  Вот, вот так вот.  Ну и, соответственно, мы можем...  Разбить это на 70% prepayment и 30% в момент, когда мы с вами заканчивается этот prepayment.  То есть обычно здесь чуть более гибко.  Понятно. А есть у тебя кто в трафике хорошо понимает? Причем это, наверное, какой-то...  Про инфлюенс во многом.  То есть я вижу, что работают пользователи, у конкурентов, у них работают, они берут какие-то смехи.  ...нежные запросы, ну, для меня это было бы, например, как транскрибировать звонок, что-нибудь такое, там, файл звонок, и кто-нибудь говорит, эй, привет, я тебе расскажу, как транскрибировать звонок, заходи.  Вот на этой странице кидаешь бесплатно, получаешь транскрипт.  Смотри, именно по трафику вот сейчас с первого раза не могу никого вспомнить.  Вот, но я могу посоветоваться, в общем, подумать про это.  Потому что, в принципе, трафиком, я думаю, сейчас много кто занимается.  Это такая тема довольно актуальная.\n",

Yeah, we'll send you all the details,  like exactly what it would look like.  But yeah, I mean, that's kind of the point of what...  why we're moving this direction.  Some of the partners that we're working with, they have expressed that they want to work on the product.  They don't want to focus on any sort of content.  And so we can take over all the content for both the founder and the brand itself and grow audiences for that, for both parties. And then, I mean, that's going to be hugely beneficial.  We, you know, we create, we have writers that work with us, but we create all the content.  There's no, it's not AI generated.  We use AI to do various targeting things, you know, and engagement activities.  like, subsequent engagement activities, I suppose.

Awesome.  Staying in the loop of creating this content like us in the chain.  not to stay outside because staying outside I am pretty sure I know that I had this it would bring you something And that you 100% will not, yeah, it's not your product, not your content.

But like Phil said, like, you know, we have the knowledge and expertise to not only put it together in a way that's well, but quickly.  And the second thing is like, you know, we're also gonna be utilizing our, influencer network that we've been aggregating.  Part of the reason we're targeting Twitter first and not LinkedIn right now is not just because we have probably more knowledge of Twitter, but we've been aggregating a huge influencer network for a long time.  know, um, you know, and we we pay for that exposure out of our pockets.

Вот тем более, если мы говорим про B2B-компании, там все равно как бы контракты уже другие, все равно комплексные решения и встречи.  Встречи, они, я думаю, что необходимы, не так, чтобы просто поднимать руку.  Да, ну, в принципе, это одна из каких-то ближайших все равно вещей, которые по маркетингу.  я хотел бы делать а если вот одна из ближайших то на какой срок примерно ориентируешься ну то есть скажем три месяца полгода  полгода вот через какое через какое время начать такими горизонтами вообще  Ага.  Вот. Но на этой неделе, наверное, нет.  Вот так бы я сказал.  Это хорошо.  Хорошо, это понятно. Ну, то есть, скажем, не знаю...  В то же время и сказать тоже наперед невозможно, потому что очень динамично происходит.  Импульс-реакция. Поэтому в таких условиях трудно что-то планировать сильно наперёд.\n",

Вот это первый момент. Я думаю, что не совсем актуально, потому что команды все равно нет.  Второй момент – это в формате ежемесячного введения, то есть пять раз в неделю, как полноценный сотрудник, только в формате такого портайма, проектной работы, занятости.  Каждый день, то есть я точно так же проверяю ответы, их передаю, закрываю возражения, смотрю, что просылка шла, если есть какие-то нюансы, баги, проблемы, это все...  за мной, опять же, буквы встречи, в поле интереса самостоятельно, что не нужно этим быть.  Ну, в общем-то, это такая полноценная позиция как в штате.  только она в таком проектном формате вот я занимаюсь либо только автоматизация линка то есть весь процесс происходит автоматически Он согласуется, то есть работа максимально прозрачная, потому что доступы как раз-таки клиентские, да, и в любой момент можно зайти посмотреть, какая переписка, сколько добавилось людей.  и точно такая же история на почте.  Поэтому либо момент того, что это в линке все происходит, либо самый эффективный заход – это как раз-таки параллельный, когда линк плюс имейл.\n",

Поэтому я немножко отвлекся. Ты мне предложение сформулируй, пожалуйста, в 250 символов.  И тогда разбежимся пока что.  По переписке ты имеешь в виду в Телеграм?  Нет, ну Телеграм, кстати, Телеграм тоже может быть, может быть.  Может быть. Так, давай сейчас сосредоточимся. Что ты про Телеграмм сказала?  Ты сказала о том, чтобы сформулировать тебе...  ...сообщение в 250 символов, поэтому я спрашиваю, что ты имеешь под этим?  В Telegram написать конкретное коммерческое предложение вообще?  Ну, да, коммерческое предложение, да, предложение какое-то, да, сформулировать. Вот.  Вот. Есть такое...  Такое ощущение, что надо идти в команды, которые занимаются Web3-разработкой, и у нас есть хороший отклик из большинства.  Из Бразилии. И может быть, и то, и то, может быть на одно, на это и на то.  сориентироваться. Бразилия и ВОП-3.  Ну, это очень важные тоже нюансы, которые...  которые мы потом будем обсуждать.

Единственный момент, что хотела сказать, что я работаю как раз-таки в том формате, когда у клиента уже есть понимание четкое своей целевой аудитории.  И перед тем, как приступить к работе, я делаю предварительный тест, ...тест для того, чтобы показать в формате скринкаста как раз-таки, сколько находится целевой аудитории, насколько целесообразно запускать автоматику и вообще насколько...  насколько люди живые. Но в целом, если мы говорим про зарубежный рынок, то с этим проблем нет, это больше там перестраховка для российского рынка, вот, поэтому, если хочется, то я могу сделать это.  Пусть сделают этот тест дополнительно, то есть как, не знаю, просто такой момент проверки, вот, ну и также отправлю коммерческое.  Окей.  Ладно. Тест, но у тебя какие-то вводные на этот тест нужны?  Да, я отправлю после звонка критерии, пункты, которые нужно будет расписать, ответить.  Исходя из них, я собираю как раз-таки это все в единую картину и показываю.  Окей, договорились.\n",

Another, okay.  Yeah, because I feel like his publication was sometimes in September.  Can we check what was the date he actually published his YouTube video?  let me see that lucas published the video yes yes it was the 26th of september 26th of september okay so  Peace.  okay 26th of september yeah it looks like uh there was something 26 yeah we had eight new registration and nine and uh and then uh it's still like  And then from then it's...  And from that time we had a lot of Brazilian registrations.  That's great. Yeah, because I actually noticed the other day that this is something that Lucas commented with me at the time when he suggested said let's do a youtube video because he said the youtube will be um it's almost like an encyclopedia because the story the reels they go away after a while but the youtube when someone is looking for something they will reach it and i noticed that the video he posted with vexa has is still getting views after lots of time yes yes  it's not that long it will yeah it will have prolonged effect yes exactly it can it can work for years and since there is actually he he made video with the previous version of the extension yeah previous version of the dashboard and he basically didn't even touch the dashboard as as it was so it might he delivered the new Yes, and even if he would mention Vexile with every of his videos, it still would work.  because what work is that people hear about thing multiple times yeah is that uh once they just didn't notice another time they noticed but they don't have a problem next time they have a problem and they have some they just remember some And the other time they are actively looking for this thing that they heard about that I know by myself. It's very typical behavior, usual behavior.  Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Yeah.

I don't know if I can share the screen.  But, for example, if we get more photos that are more corporate, you know, they can get more, add trust to the company as well.  You know, when people go into VEX after going from the, from the influencer or from Seeing some, if we do ads first, for example, we can also promote the video that Lucas posted.  I don't know if you consider that we can, the video that Lucas posted, we can, you can make a paid promo with it on youtube or even on instagram like as a real  yeah i have a stupid problem with instagram I was I think I was blocked for life Instagram really what happened I just made a pretty stupid attempt to to scrape Instagram with my own you know headers I can I can help you did something how happen in the vexa  Instagram not vexa I'm about my own  which is okay which is uh you don't like instagram i would like i just don't have access to instagram for now i used to use it and i uh i just played around with instagram data scraping this data once uh uh about a couple of years ago so they just blocked me uh with my facebook no way so but we can make a  i can manage that if you want i can it's pretty easy to set up uh um another account that's an ads account yeah through facebook I can set it up and if you send me your Facebook link, do you still have a Facebook or no?

And then some were more completely promotional. So get our product for this amount of time. Why this is perfect.  and highlighting the value.  So we had some different kinds of buckets.  And then for example, one thing, our main social media was LinkedIn.  One content bucket that we see is very popular on LinkedIn is the team.  It gets a lot of traction and it actually for the product is something that at first first glance we think oh that's not really helpful for the product but it helps a lot with the engagement rates of the company so it enhances the company's the the company's page presence which therefore for enhances the how the product uh posts will be available for the rest of the people so this is some of the stuff that i did at build tricks yeah tricks  mm-hmm how can I see more about what you've done there at the content Do you have a LinkedIn profile?

I don't really like working B2B, I have to say. I prefer working B2C. It makes me happier. It makes me...  I prefer talking to the customer, I think that I have a knack for understanding the customer, you know, I feel that I know what people want.  and i like talking to them about it i like feel i like the pleasure it gets me when i understand them uh means like you're more like  on a product manager management site like talking to customers and customer development interviews all this all this stuff  Sim, eu quero dizer, quando eu estava, por exemplo, quando no Beatrix o conteúdo é muito mais impessoal, sabe, é muito mais...  Mesmo o copywriting, o que eu tenho que dizer ao cliente é muito mais impessoal.  O valor, o benefício que eu tenho que oferecer.  is more impersonal. It's not how that person will improve its life, it's how the company will improve their life. And for example, when I was working with you guys in Vexa, that was something way more fulfilling for me and that's what what showed me that i actually wanted to go more uh go back into b2c so i'm yeah i'm actually looking for stuff in more related to b2c and you perceive the access to b2c product i think you guys have both right i think that there is uh the free use part there is the the paid part for the consumer but there is also the big the big part net right which is where you get most i think of the it's where the the the mark the big value of the company will be right is selling to big companies but yeah i think that i believe that as as a startup fax will first grow in the consumer right and\n",

       "  > Dmitry Grankin:  Currently, the idea is that we are kind of implementing is that we approach individuals improving their day-to-day work working setup but sure enough this most likely this individuals are part of a company employees yeah and so the idea is that we could potentially if penetrate these companies through these individuals bottom up yeah and uh but actually this top-down approach could potentially work as well because there is something that blocks this bottom-up approach because of uh the security and privacy issues yeah from power and privacy policies they have and these things have to be addressed top down top down yes and we have an idea of a solution for that is that currently works is works uh server service in multiple clients and you have to trust vexa to uh to secure the data If you don't want to do this, the idea is that you can deploy your own VEX backend inside your company infrastructure.  That's a great idea.  Yeah, and that's the way for those who want to to use this kind of service, but cannot.  Yeah, that sounds great.  And there's a lot of users who basically They use VXR silently and they have no power to introduce VXR in silence.  that these companies because of these problems decisions  yeah i think that um do you also think in terms of new integrations Porque eu estava falando com algumas pessoas, por exemplo, eu conheço algumas pessoas no Venture Capital Building, mas no British Telecom, e eles said the product is amazing but they also have this barrier and even if they didn't they use for example they use teams so considering that is that in your you  Yeah, new integration is something that is kind of an obvious way to go to expand, but even in this google meet environment there is still a lot of opportunities for now and in order You have limited resources where you want to go, whether you want to go and expand horizontally with new integrations or vertically to get...  more into the value the product delivers to the end customer.\n",

       "  > Dmitry Grankin:  And I chose, for now, I chose the second approach because there is actually a lot of companies teams uh that are into google meet hundred percent and um these are smaller teams smaller companies uh more modern ones and a lot of this web3 and all this web3 Maniacs, they are all into Google Meet 100%.  So I don't say I don't want to work with large corporations who are entirely on Microsoft Teams I want, but I just don't have enough resources to tackle the both  directions for now yeah okay all right so okay so in terms of uh the content that we will be creating So, should we go forward? You want Instagram, new Instagram posts?  I think the right approach would be to forget what the actual product is and start from search engine optimization start from what people actually are looking for around the problem area we're in and deliverance content and maybe even micro products.  for that specific problems like the example is that I recently researched tactic tactic is yeah yeah it's a competitor The thing they were doing is that they probably noticed that there is such a problem as people searching on how to acquire transcripts from YouTube yeah and saw that as well which is a pretty straightforward thing yeah you can get it from API easily like it's the latest it's like this it's it's a very common request so basically what you do is you create a a page where and you will just drop drag and drop this your youtube link and get a transcript and you create a little bit of contact on youtube hey guys come in and we will give you this that's how it works how to fulfill your specific request they type in how to get transcripts from youtube and here it is that's how you do it it's free no strings attached come and get it and so you get this traffic and and then you find a way on how to convert.  And basically the way to convert is, is give them this product, this tool, script directly in the dashboard so that they got they found themselves in the dashboard and I see they see the capabilities okay here we can add new more youtube videos and then search uh and then search this youtube videos create another content from this youtube videos or we can download extension and at calls for meetings there or whatever um so i'll probably go for this multi-step  Maybe it's  so overcomplicated for probably but better take some straightforward steps first like I I see what you mean though  and I think that it can it can be a uma introdução para um caminho em frente, eu posso pensar sobre isso.  Se você tem alguma outra ideia também, em termos do briefing, porque isso é realmente about tactic from when we first started working together.  I researched them, I researched the competitors, but then the other day I needed a transcript from YouTube and I stumbled upon that.  So, yeah.\n",
       "- [37:07] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and Lara Vargas discussing strategies for content creation and influencer marketing for VEXA. They explore the effectiveness of leveraging influencers with established audiences versus creating original content based on user search behavior, emphasizing the importance of understanding audience needs and preferences in their marketing approach.\n",
       "  > Dmitry Grankin:  the state world for we just just to create the content about about the exa but we don't actually know uh if that would work right uh we know that if we we have an influencer with their own established audience that this audience will get in touch with the content created by this influencer.  That's what we know. If we create our own content, but we don't know if it will resonate at any way uh to make life easier better do um to start from what people search and create content for what people search around the problem area we are we attacked yeah i think that  Eu acho que isso pode ser feito. Eu acho que, por exemplo, uma coisa que eu vi é que muitas vezes o tipo de influencer que There is a type of influencer that is tips and tricks influencer.  So this type of influencer, lots of times they are not directly where your consumer is, but that specific video will go to your consumers for you page. Because the the content of it has to do with what they want in that specific context of the tips and tricks, so yeah, I think that this is something that I researched some of them, they were just a bit outside.  of the target that we were looking for that time, but I can reach out to them again and see.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay, so basically I see a tool, first of all.  If you want to create content, then start with the content.  research, with the research of what people are actually looking for. Otherwise, if we integration that we can just say here is the product you know your audience you you know what you want to deliver to your audience what do you like what they're expecting from you, you know much better how to present it.  These two ways, both would work, I believe.  At least for now we know that one of these things works.\n",

Você está com a sua viagem programada para o final do ano?  Onde você está buscando mais?  É, claro, Google.  Acabou sendo muito forte. Eu...  Eu aumentaria de novo no Google, mas estamos seguindo a estratégia que o cliente tinha falado.  Tá.  Ele falou, pelo menos na última vez que eu peguei feedback, na semana passada, que o fechamento estava muito bom, estava super bom.  Legal, mesmo que ele comentou lá, acho que não sei se ele viu errado, que ele falou que aquele dia lá ele achou que estava com 170 de custo no dia lá, mas era 112 que você falou, aí ele achou que estava maior e tal.  Eu falei, não, eu expliquei para ele bem certinho e tal, né, expliquei daquele dia.  É justo lá, ele falou, não, é verdade.  Ele falou, não, se quiser a gente reduz, não sei o quê, não sei se precisa reduzir, porque eles estão se mudando para o Brasil agora.  Aí ele falou, não, não, deixa aí que está bom por enquanto.  Se continuar, se não estiver bom, eu peço que a gente reduz.  O fechamento estava bem interessante, aí eu vou ver como é que está indo agora, porque agora acho que vai dar quase um mês, a gente já reduziu o Google, mas só daí dá para ter um parâmetro legal.

Precisava de um feedback se eles estão tendo essa procura mesmo de...  É, o que ela me passou aqui, ó.  Eu até pedi.  Ó, enviando um feedback dos clientes que entraram em contato do dia 9 ao dia 13.  Ela passou aqui.  Aham.  Desculpa.  Foram 12 clientes interessados, que efetivamente chamaram eles lá.  Eu estou pedindo para ela me passar todo o segundo feedback, né?  E apenas um agendamento foi gerado.  De novo, deles é normal ter uma resistência maior.

Só que daí assim, eu não dei a sugestão de, ah, putz, de repente tirar o valor, fazer ela gratuita, eu não sei se vale a pena para eles. Por quê?  Pelo lead que está vindo ali, para eles, ela comentou, ó, alguns são só curiosidade, Perguntam como funciona para empreender em Portugal, por exemplo.  Ficam perguntando o que é que precisa e tal.  Outros perguntam quais documentos precisam para a cidadania, entendeu?  Então, tem muita gente que fica perguntando essas coisas.  A maioria não agenda porque é paga e eles ficam tirando essas aí eu não sei como é que a gente contorna isso eu imagino criativo, criativo  vai ter que alterar essa comunicação deixa eu só ver a gente tem algum de Portugal Tem aquele de empreender em Portugal lá.  Garanta seu futuro.  É, esse que eu comentei com você.  Mas é justamente por isso.  As pessoas estão com dúvida nisso.  Eu trocaria essa chamada de empreender em Portugal, tipo, ou para alguma coisa de cidadania portuguesa, talvez.  Tá.  Eu acho que vai ser melhor, porque daí a pessoa deve gerar uma curiosidade, empreenda em Portugal.  Aí a pessoa vai querer saber...  A BA vai gerar muitas dúvidas, entendeu?  Encontre um lugar para pertencer e prosperar, entendeu?  Tá. É porque, assim, o problema é que as pessoas tiram dúvida.  Só que aí o que eu estou fazendo é o seguinte...  Será que as pessoas seriam leads qualificadas já, só que a gente fez a comunicação errada e ela está tirando dúvida, não dá nada?  Ou se o que eu estou achando que me parece ser é que de repente não são leads?  que virariam clientes, entendeu?  A pessoa chamou por curiosidade, porque de repente está se ferrando aqui no Brasil, quer ir para Portugal porque falam que é melhor ir para lá, só que a pessoa não é qualificada, entendeu?  Isso eu não sei.  Eu acredito que é muito...  Muito a comunicação, Nicolas, porque a pessoa vai ver o que o criativo tá falando, né?  Emprenda em Portugal ali, pô, pra mim gera uma curiosidade.  O que que eu tô... Que casa é de Itália? Tudo bem.  Eu sou uma pessoa que vou olhar ali o perfil do Instagram dos caras, vou ver o que eles Mas, tipo, eu li num criativo, empreenda em Portugal.  Eu vou clicar naquele criativo, eu quero saber como é que eu faço isso.  Muitas vezes a pessoa se quebra ali já.  Ela achou que era só, a pessoa vai ter alguma informação para me passar.

Como eles que mexem nessas conversões ali, pode às vezes dar uma...  Mas se precisar, eu acho que só com eles lá para cobrar esse vídeo.  Deixa eu só colocar aqui, tag, conversões.  Ok.  Eu só queria tirar duas dúvidas contigo.  Certo.  Uma delas, sobre alguns testes de campanha que a gente comentou, que vocês também tinham comentado de fazer na semana passada, retrasado, um deles, não me lembro, mas a gente já lembra que a gente comentou sobre, ele tentou testar campanhas de ligação também, tudo, enfim.  Sim, sim, sim.  Como é que foram esses testes, assim?  Tá, a campanha de ligação...  a ligação ela ficou ela não teve tanta qualificação como eu tava imaginando qualificação que eu digo tipo a campanha não performou tão bem e tipo antigamente o Google ele tinha uma campanha que era muito melhor, que era uma que você vinculava com o Google Meu Negócio, ele puxava, aí quando a pessoa buscava ali, ela dava quase 50% de chance da pessoa clicar.  que eles têm agora, tipo, a gente tava com, digamos, tava aparecendo muito abaixo, assim, tipo, primeira qualificação, tipo, primeira posição tava em 15%, e a parcela de rede de pesquisa tava em, tipo, em 27%, então tava, tipo...  tá sendo bem baixo assim então eu já tinha pausado ela já não eu vou dizer assim assim que eu vi que tipo não tava performando também deixei rodando uns três dias assim de ver que Estava dando um tambor e pausei, me desculpa.  Ela custou R$35,00, mas daí, tipo, para esse custo aqui, para a porcentagem que estava aparecendo, assim, o CTR baixo, também nem custava muito.  E a que eu criei nova lá, que era de aqui, ó, Leeds.  Alarmes e cercas, que daí eram conjuntos separados, né?  Alarmes e cerca e o segurança residencial.  Também, tipo, performou mais ou menos, tipo, os termos estavam bem aqui, deixa eu te falar.  Alarmes de cerca elétrica, sistema de segurança residencial, tipo, estavam muito certeiras as palavras.  Tanto que a taxa de interação estava em, tipo...  em 100%.  Tipo, a pessoa que viu o anúncio, ela já clicava.  Mas não estava tendo conversão.  Aí eu entrei no site, tipo...  Eu tive que pausar a campanha porque estava performando melhor aquela nossa padrãozinha, que ela utiliza o termo geral, que é segurança residencial, deixa eu colocar aqui os termos que estão Que daí foram as conversões que eles conseguiram registrar.  Tá, mas tem uma dúvida.  Que campanhas estão rodando hoje?  Eu lembro que tinha aquela de Pemax também, mas quais estão rodando hoje?  Tá, a que estão rodando hoje é a...  O search padrão.  Do serviço.  Oi?  É o search lá de serviço, lá de câmera.  Isso, isso.  O padrão, aquela nossa, uma das nossas primeiras.  O serviço eu estou rodando ela com o valor mais baixo, ela está rodando a R$10.  A Pimax não estava gerando resultado, a conversão dela estava bem cara, tanto que eu tive que pausar.

Perguntei também no META que ela vai ser mais útil no META do que no Google.  Ah, tá.  Tá.  Beleza.  Ela tinha dado aquele probleminha que a gente já tentou para o...  Não lembro para qual outro cliente que a gente tinha uma lista.  Ela se foi para turismo uma vez que a gente tentou colocar.  É muito específico essas planilhinhas que entram no Google.  Eles precisam, a inteligência precisa de uma grande quantidade de números de informações.  pra ela poder rodar, sabe?  Entendi. Ah, beleza.  Só pra saber.  Ok.  É, CWB.

Depois precisa ter uma...  É, até depois eu até vou ver se eu coloco na descrição do nosso grupo lá, pra vocês irem acompanhando também.  O que eu fui percebendo, ó, se vocês forem ver, esse aqui é do mês de novembro, essa área aqui.  Aqui a gente percebe, ó, 20, uma média...  aqui mais ou menos 20, 20 e poucos por semana, comecinho de novembro, aqui depois subiu para uns 50, 40 por semana, e aqui também manteve uns 50, 60, dependendo, aqui 70, mais ou menos a média, Deu uma aumentada.  E agora, aqui manteve uma média de uns 90, 100.  E mais ainda, essa semana.  Está bem aqui.  Então, 130 mais ou menos de média, 140 de média por dia.  E essa semana aqui, que foi a que mais teve volume, foi semana passada.  Deu aqui a somatória 974.  Claro que aqui acredito que vende todos os canais.  Enfim, de qualquer forma, foi a semana que mais teve...  Se veio esses 500, por exemplo, mais da metade veio do tráfego ali.  Só que eu quero pegar com ela a qualificação disso.  Ela tinha comentado o problema da qualificação antes.  Mas eu vou ver se de repente...  ...domingo também manteve assim, eu vou depois pegar o feedback.  Mas isso aqui é em volume, né, que ela passou pra nós.  É, o que, então, Mata, a gente teve 554 e no Google foram 171.  É, gostei.  Por conversão de 222, daria 725 conversões, se fosse bater.  É, então deu 250 por fora e o 700 e pouquinho.  É, 250 por fora e 700 e poucas nossas.  Eu acredito que agora essas otimizações que o Gabriel fez ali é para ter melhorado.  ...público, assim, que ele deixou bem selecionado agora, sabe?  Colocou bastante interesse, algumas áreas também ele mexeu.  Tá, beleza.  E multibarras...  A gente teve uma redução boa no...  Deixa eu só ver aqui.  Multibarras, a gente teve uma redução no nosso custo por conversão pra R$6,70.  Deixa eu só te falar quanto que tá o preço.  peraí, peraí, peraí 18...  28 tava em 12, tava em 12 reais então deu uma reduzida boa Teve 26 conversões.

Contar os quatro, são três mulheres e um cara só.  E todos os arquitetos.  E daí ele vai lá e vai tirar as fotos profissionais de todos eles, juntos ou não, enfim e tal.  Aí dá para pensar, por exemplo, uma foto da equipe toda.  Falando da história da Hound, uma equipe só, uma foto só com alguns deles, tipo, conheçam os profissionais, ou a equipe Hound, ou sei lá, ou...  O que a gente precisa, é que, Nicolas, te falando bem, é verdade, assim, a pessoa que tá buscando, tipo, um arquiteto...  projeto por eu só quero saber do projeto assim não me importa muito a equipe eu só quero tipo tudo bem quero saber a história de um criativo falando a história mas daí vou rodar para mas se eu quero contratar um serviço se eu quero entrar em contato com eles, tem que ser projeto pedir tudo que eles tiverem de vídeo de transformação é o que chama atenção não tem jeito  Eu vou pedir tudo o que tiver lá, mas os deles vão subindo também, beleza.  Daí, assim que colocarem no Drive, eu até vou ver se eles colocaram alguma coisa, então eu te dou um toque.  O deles era isso, eu preciso só montar o reporteio lá ainda.  Ok.

       "- [09:07] This chunk occurs during a conversation between Sunny Wyrzykowski and Dmitry Grankin, where they discuss Dmitry's current marketing efforts and strategies for acquiring new clients for his product. Sunny inquires about the effectiveness of outreach methods beyond word of mouth, leading to a discussion about their experiences with platforms like Product Hunt, LinkedIn, and influencer marketing in Brazil.\n",
       "  > Sunny Wyrzykowski:  Have you tried to, I know you mentioned that you right now, it's mostly just word of mouth.  Have you tried?  to you know do some outreach or other kind of ways of of getting more clients or have you  just kind of focused on word of mouth for now yeah but we've tried product product hunt we've been semi-active on linkedin basically responding to incoming outreach doing some outbound outreach just just little bit uh we tried um we've dry we've tried influencer uh integration with the with it with micro influencer in Brazil and that was quite successful nice well it looks like we are getting those users as a result of that activity  activity now from brazilians from brazil uh-huh so when you mentioned you've tried you know like linkedin a little bit of linkedin outreach and stuff like that has that worked out pretty well for you or um how has that kind of worked out so far  um you know it's a kind of natural uh natural behavior to to communicate with people that are willing to communicate with you and there's nothing really and no deliberate action taken about that and on those things we tried as a deliberate action didn't work that well maybe because It wasn't done in the right way, like automated outreach that looked pretty silly to be honest with you.  Mm-hmm.\n",
       "- [24:26] This chunk occurs during a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and Sunny Wyrzykowski, where Dmitry discusses the advantages of his product, Vexa, in comparison to another product, Fathom. He highlights Vexa's unique features, such as its silent operation during calls and multilingual capabilities, while also emphasizing its ability to build collective knowledge from meetings. This discussion is part of a broader dialogue about business strategies and user acquisition.\n",
       "  > Dmitry Grankin:  Okay, so you are absolutely happy about this product nothing really bothers you okay cool that's one of a few products with which i i hear i hear that okay great i i encourage you to to try out vexa because um this what are the competitive advantage on which people are telling me not what I am telling people, but my users are telling, is that it stays silent on the call, doesn't participate.  As a meeting participant, there's some...  noise people i don't know why actually but as a matter of fact and as i mentioned earlier it's multilingual and it's seamlessly um switching from one language to another and as what I'm telling the users you know they are telling me is that we are building knowledge with that so we can research not just a specific meeting after a call, but we can actually ask general questions about who are our competitors, what users say about us.  what we've been doing the last two weeks and yeah creating reports that are derived from the full body of uh collective knowledge how how does it uh how does it sounds to you\n",

Я хочу протестировать на этой неделе то-то, получилось у меня на прошлой неделе такой-то результат.  Ну и так все остальные по кругу делятся и обсуждают, как можно там что-то новое попробовать.  Ну, я думаю, что это, наверное, из самого интересного.  Форматов огромное количество.  То есть бизнес-квартирники приглашают к себе домой резиденты, мы это все оформляем, когда можно попитчиться, мы помогаем подкатывать стартапы и приглашаем различные фонды, венчурные фонды.  ...венчурные, чтобы привлечь инвестиции.  Еще интересный бизнес – спиднетворкинг.  Это когда за день вечера можно получить порядка 20 контактов с различными фаундерами, внешними и внутри клуба.  И внутри клуба.\n"

She emphasizes the importance of professional templates and community involvement in the process, relating it to her experiences in an accelerator program focused on finding product-market fit.\\n  > Tatiana Sukhova:  Вот. И тут мы переходим как раз к идее, которую я тебе хотела сказать.  Тут меня осенило.  Это должен быть движок, в котором есть возможность создавать задания.  И задания эти должны создаваться узкими специалистами.  То есть, допустим, есть, вот как темплейты в Мира или темплейты в Notion.  То есть заходит сюда специалист по CastDev, составляет тебе темплейты.  Плейт-задание. Ты должен задать такие-то вопросы.  Более того, эти вопросы сами по себе могут быть темплейтами, которые автоматически...  автоматически вообще подкрутятся под знания о твоем бизнесе.  Ну или ладно, начнем с дженерик вопросов.  Вот как, собственно, таблица зеленая, которую я сейчас показываю.  У тебя есть возможность всегда Зайти в этот темплейт, ну, как бы его клоун делать своим и что-то там под фэйн-тюнить.  Вот это задание.  Вот.  И вот это open-source такой, как бы, подход.  Это, мне кажется, очень круто, потому что чувак, который вот этот акселератор запустил, он прямо спец по поиску Product Market Fit.  И весь его акселератор можно разбить на...  вот эти там плейты а ты везде должен происход производить research кастомер джонни мэпы это еще отдельные вообще это когда уже юзер research на какие ...в каких-то фичах и продуктах.  Мы с тобой делаем это сейчас.  Ну да.  Вот.  И таких примеров бесконечное количество.  Но это должны быть профессионально созданные шаблоны.  Или комьюнити.  Комьюнити, да, комьюнити, профессионалы, созданные шаблоны.  вот такая вот в этом собственная идея может она у тебя уже была для меня это  было это прекрасно это подтверждает как бы есть же такое ты находишься В точке у тебя вокруг, знаешь, такой 360 градусов, в какую сторону двигаться, как у червя, вот он куда пойдет, где лучше пахнет, понимаешь?  Да, да, да.  Больше именно вот таких вот подтверждений. То, что я тебя спрашиваю, а как ты думаешь, лучше это или то? Это не работает. Работает, когда тебе люди говорят одно и то же, не сговариваясь.  Да, да.  Не знаю, я знаю, о чем ты говоришь.  У меня сейчас примерно то же самое, поскольку я вообще ищу, куда мне пойти.  Вообще, потому что столько вариантов.  Да, вот, другая уже идея, которая мне сегодня...\\n\\n## Meeting 12 - December 06, 2024 16:21\\n\\n- [00:00] The chunk introduces Dmitriy Grankin\\'s innovative concept for VXR, which he elaborates on throughout the document, discussing ideas related to recording and sharing online events, collaborative content creation, and the use of language models to enhance community engagement and knowledge sharing.\\n  > Dmitriy Grankin:  oh i need to say this out loud uh the concept um I envision for VXR is a pretty interesting one.\\n- [00:23] The chunk is part of a discussion by Dmitriy Grankin about his experiences and ideas related to VXR, specifically focusing on an offline event where participants engaged in discussions about partnerships within a business club setting.\\n  > Dmitriy Grankin:  As I had today, I had experienced with it in all, offline event uh with people discussing openly about something about partnerships so this was a gathering of a, say, a kind of business club.\\n- [01:20] This chunk is part of a discussion by Dmitriy Grankin about his experiences at an offline business event, where he recorded presentations and reflected on how to reposition a product to create immediate value for a larger audience. It introduces his idea for enhancing engagement and sharing within community events.\\n  > Dmitriy Grankin:  And I read it out loud with this thing that it was a kind of great presentation of the product for these guys.  So...  so that brought me about the following idea which is something is that I\\'ve been looking for ways to reposition the product the way that it can create immediate value to a large amount of people.\\n- [04:00] The chunk is part of a discussion by Dmitriy Grankin about the concept for VXR, focusing on how a large language model can be utilized to enhance content sharing and collaboration among users during online events. It highlights the role of user-generated prompts in shaping the content that the model processes.\\n  > Dmitriy Grankin:  And they got this large language model, which applies some pre preset prompt against the contact and this prompt is something that\\'s been catered by users themselves or by the community.  So here is the first or second point of share.\\n- [11:24] The chunk discusses a marketing idea related to the integration of YouTube videos into a collaborative indexing system, where users can interact with the content, create new material, and save edits alongside the original video. This concept is part of a broader vision for VXR, focusing on enhancing community engagement and content sharing during online events.\\n  > Dmitriy Grankin:  so that the marketing idea is the following we we can share these links YouTube videos is that you add a YouTube video into your index and as you interact with the agent and this way create the new content because if it\\'s something that works for you you\\'re just you\\'ll be able to edit it and save it to the same next to the original content attached to it.\\n\\n## Meeting 11 - December 06, 2024 12:05\\n\\n- [06:54] This chunk is part of a discussion where Dmitriy Grankin compares his product\\'s features with those of Microsoft Teams and Slack, addressing competition and the challenges posed by larger companies with more resources. It highlights the limitations of existing platforms and the potential for differentiation in a sparse market.\\n  > Dmitriy Grankin:  have you have you used teams teams before and for not yeah uh microsoft teams yeah not yet unfortunately it has a feature like this right so it does exactly same thing however it doesn\\'t do the suggested actions and the it doesn\\'t do a couple of things but what will stop them from doing this in uh in teams and in slack i think about nothing would stop us it\\'s like when people ask about competition i\\'d say these situations like imagine a bus like later in the ...evening and you have like a capacity of 80 people in the bus and you have two people in the bus and it stops and another two people come. That\\'s the daily situation on the It\\'s very sparse. There is like a lot of interest and a lot of curiosity, some competitors, but it\\'s pretty much like...  we don\\'t even know you know which is 80% let\\'s say and then the other the other 20 percent 50 percent of them they use slack and they both have the same features slack has it\\'s working on this and they\\'re they\\'re gonna do it even better better whatever every time features and all that and it\\'s not only you but they have 300 engineers doing the working or not uh and then uh teams has not only their own copilot issues but they the whole OpenAI engineering team, and they get all the features first.  They get 5.0, 6.0, 7.0 GPT access two months in advance than you do.\\n\\n## Meeting 18 - December 17, 2024 04:29\\n\\n- [14:10] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dianna Lloyd and Marcus Torrisi discussing the use of a free CRM for a startup\\'s website, the tracking of emails and meetings, and the preparation of workflows and documents for client interactions. It highlights their collaborative approach to managing client projects and ensuring effective communication and documentation.\\n  > Dianna Lloyd:  Yeah, I\\'m using one for network code. It\\'s a free one. And it\\'s really limited. It\\'s very limited. And I\\'m, I\\'m shopping right now for another customer of mine. And I\\'ve told her build her her website on the c3 crm because she has she\\'s a startup and i just think it\\'s the best way of starting as a free like even if she doesn\\'t use hubspot i still think it\\'s worthwhile. If you just need to have some landing pages and you need to have a presence in some forms, it\\'s free. Like I don\\'t see the drawback for it.  Yeah. So that\\'s what I\\'m doing. Yeah. So that\\'s what, that\\'s what we\\'re in the  it of it now but in regards to like logging emails looking at meetings that are against contact records or deals or companies that should all be there with your level of access i\\'ll have a look  can make sure it\\'s all working right so that you know because i have like meetings set up and emails back and forth i\\'ll just double check now that i can see i\\'ll just double check that everything\\'s mapping correctly and all of that um  So I can see, like, everything with, like, Samantha this afternoon is tracking in there.  Okay.  Yeah, which is good.  Okay.  Cool.  Alright, so that\\'s your plan for me. That was my question. What\\'s the plan for me?  So I\\'m meeting with I think I\\'m not meeting with Samantha today.  I think the only one that\\'s interested is Shannon.  So it must be Shannon.  Samantha doesn\\'t give a poop.  Yeah, sure.  So yeah, fine, whatever.  I\\'ll talk to her and see what She wants, and she can be the middleman for passing on the ideas.  I can really pass on the ideas, right?  Like, no, no, that\\'s right.  Exactly.  Right.  And that\\'s all you need to do.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And just say like, you know, based on my experience this is what i thought would work yeah yeah exactly and if they don\\'t if they don\\'t take it on will you you go well here\\'s your here\\'s your workflow is your workflow here\\'s  your email is it ready to go you want me to turn it on all right okay  yeah so don\\'t yeah don\\'t don\\'t stress about it too much if they don\\'t take i\\'m sure she\\'ll take on the feedback because you\\'ve got good ideas but like if she goes nah we want to do this you just have to go yeah all right we\\'ll just do what you want  You\\'ll see in the document or the e-mail I shared with you, probably had a link to the Taurus sales contact form journey.  Yeah.  You may or may not be interested in using this is sort of sort of document or if you have something that\\'s different that you want to use with clients to sort of walk them through a workflow and this is actually two workflows in this document because it helps better explain.  This is what I\\'m gonna walk her through when we go through it.  Like I said, you come in by this, then there\\'s the next one.  And this is the experience, right?  So, and then we can, just walk through it quite easy and then she can you know i\\'ve got the original brief in there um  and then was this the one was this the one that it was like left to right like showing the flow of the of the workflow, is that the one that you want me to talk about?  No, I\\'ll share my screen.  It\\'s just a spreadsheet.  It\\'s just a very basic document is to like kind of track what has been done and then just to walk them through it.  So like once we start building something, they can see and you can walk them through it.  This is what the customer experience is, right?  So especially when it comes to a market.  getting and you know maybe even sequences we could add in there you know and just say this is their experience to the whole thing because I think that\\'s what happens with these people is a lot of times is they just don\\'t see the end entire picture of the customer journey in that one thing.  And this is the version so that we could always use this document going back between the two groups.  Just saying, this is what we did.  I have to make a version two, you know, so I\\'ve got next step suggestions and things like that.  They can use this to talk to their team about what was done.  Yeah.\\n\\n## Meeting 8 - December 05, 2024 11:02\\n\\n- [06:19] In a conversation between Alex Shevliakov and Dmitry Grankin about various projects and product development, Alex discusses the potential value of a solution targeted at teams within businesses, emphasizing the importance of understanding user cases and gathering feedback for improvement.\\n  > Alex Shevliakov:  Слушай, мне кажется, что я прям вижу ценность в такой штуке.  И мне кажется, что ценность, конечно же, будет, когда у тебя есть команда.  Я имею в виду, ты продаешь от Солюшен какой-то другой бизнес, и там есть команда.  Да.  Мне кажется, прямо туда и стоит таргетироваться.  И мне кажется, что уже на данном этапе...  Было бы круто им показывать, спрашивать, как бы вы такое использовали в своем юзкейсе.  А лучше даже попробовать их использовать, это в их юзкейсе.  Да.  Потому что...\\n- [12:44] In this conversation between Alex Shevliakov and Dmitry Grankin, they discuss various aspects of project development, user engagement, and growth strategies for a product called VEX. The chunk focuses on Alex\\'s perspective regarding the value of VEX in generating and obtaining information within companies, emphasizing the importance of organic growth and the absence of advertising in their user acquisition strategy.\\n  > Alex Shevliakov:  Мне кажется, что ценность даже больше у VEX именно в том, чтобы информацию внутри компании генерировать и получать. Не знаю, как там будет шар работать на органическом  Ну, я пообщался с клиентом, я ему скинул ссылочку. Мне не нужен никакой файл, флоп делает может быть вот сама разбирайся чем это но это здесь ничего нового Нет, делают все конкуренты, и по косвенным признакам видно, что у них никакого другого механизма роста и нет, кроме органического.  Нет никакой рекламы, есть вот трафик весь органический, либо брендовый в поисковике, либо прямой заход на сайт. Откуда это берется?  Должен быть какой-то то, что называется product-led growth.\\n- [14:00] In this conversation between Alex Shevliakov and Dmitry Grankin, they discuss various aspects of product development, user engagement, and marketing strategies. The chunk focuses on the importance of integrating calendar functionalities into a product, the challenges of making a product appealing, and the pitfalls of prioritizing superficial attractiveness over functionality. Dmitry reflects on past experiences with influencers and the need for a solid product foundation before scaling efforts.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  Это механизм, но они используют широко интеграцию с календарем, Ты получаешь имейлы всех пользователей на звонках своих пользователей, рассылаешь им фоллоуапы.  вот это вот это наверное еще круче интересно наверное вот но здесь надо искать ценность для того чтобы получить эту интеграцию с календарем  Да, есть такое. Сложно. Не знаю.  Я помню, мы пробовали много с инфлюенсерами, а там гипотеза.  Там нужно очень много... Там нужно, чтобы продукт был невероятно привлекательный со всех сторон, именно как первый шаг. Остальные шаги неважны.  То есть там чаще даже делают какой-то очень внешне X-овый привлекательный продукт с классными превьюшками, но он может на первом же этапе ломаться и не работать дальше.  Но так...  Проверяют, идет ли трафик или нет.  Но это вообще с другой стороны.  Мне кажется, что не стоит туда идти.  Там свои проблемы.  Там продукт разрабатывается так, что сначала делается фасад.  а потом уже fake it until I make it, через годик будет продукт.  Мне кажется,  у тебя прям точно можно цеплять именно тем, что это готовый продукт, он работает.  Знаешь,\\n\\n## Meeting 5 - December 03, 2024 18:40\\n\\n- [12:20] The chunk is part of a conversation between Sergio Goriachev and Dmitriy Grankin discussing business ideas and strategies related to a potential project. Sergio is preparing for an upcoming call and is seeking to clarify and develop ideas about market opportunities and traffic generation for their venture.\\n  > Sergio Goriachev:  Давай разгоним про этот скл.  Потому что у меня завтра со звончиком, и мне хорошо будет что-то про это рассказать поподробнее.  Потому что я чисто вчера перед сном окончательно к этой мысли пришел, что можно это апплайить.  говорю, с типсом обсудил, который типа менторит, он сказал, что да, welcome, надо теперь из этого сделать не презентажку, показать какие-то цифры, что тут вообще есть рынок, но, как я говорю, Мое подозрение, что рынок достаточный.  И... что-что-что?  Расскажи, пожалуйста.  Про трафик, наверное.\\n- [15:14] This chunk is part of a conversation between Sergio Goriachev and Dmitriy Grankin discussing business strategies, specifically focusing on testing hypotheses for a startup project. They explore the potential for collaboration, the importance of user retention, and the need for investor engagement to assess the product\\'s viability and future funding opportunities.\\n  > Sergio Goriachev:  Надо вот там, допустим, ну, опять же, это все через шортсы двигается условно-бесплатно, но вот мы говорим, что у нас там на месяц нужно 3-4-5 таких, и гипотез проверить, на это есть 4K, надо делать.  Ну, короче, нам на самом деле цель этого созвона, с тобой договориться, ты хочешь нечто подобное делать, просто потому что, опять же, это твоя штукенция, мне гораздо проще будет...  ну, вот с Airbnb, да, мне гораздо проще с тобой договориться и попробовать ее внедрять, потому что конкретно VEX, ну, во-первых, мне не очень удобно тебя склонять, да, потому что это...  полностью твой стартап и отдавать 90 процентов ну странно но как я уже на предыдущем  ассасмент сделали потому что отдать 90 процентов в любом случае это же не не то о чем мы сейчас говорим, о том, что давай что-нибудь тестировать.  Это уже все-таки чуть больше.  Поэтому если...  90% подписывается на все раунды фактически.  Да, вопрос...  В любом случае мне интересно, как они ее оценят. Я с инвесторами регулярно пытаюсь общаться, чтобы понять, что они сейчас могут предложить.  Этот вопрос задам и скажу, вот так и так, есть продукт, есть там какие-то первые пользователи, есть...  Что еще есть?  Есть. Да, есть бесплатные пользователи. Ретеншин хороший есть. Многонедельный ретеншин, несколько десятков пользователей.  У пользователей постоянно появляются новые пользователи, там 2, 3, 4 пользователя новых, появляются по word of mouth, как-то появляются.  — Окей, хорошо. Ну, я думаю, это можно будет... Короче, я эту темку подниму, спрошу, как с этим действовать дальше, и, возможно, кто-то к тебе придет или отчиток.  Контактик скину оттуда, чтобы на этот счет поговорить.\\n- [17:29] In this segment of the conversation, Sergio Goriachev discusses a business hypothesis related to an R&B&B concept, emphasizing the potential for a low-effort execution that could lead to a \"free exit\" strategy. He outlines how this approach could attract investment for future funding rounds, ultimately leading to a profitable exit at a higher valuation. This discussion is part of a broader dialogue about leveraging financial opportunities and strategies in trading and investment.\\n  > Sergio Goriachev:  Но, опять же, та гипотеза, которую совсем не жалко, на мой взгляд, это вот это R&B&B.  То есть я думаю, она тебе нахрен не упала.  мне в целом я просто придумал что вокруг нее сделать на для меня вас в этой историки сказал важен если я смогу это протащить с минимальными усилиями потому что подключу какого-нибудь там знакомого продакта чтобы он не помогал мне помогал, потому что я много чего делаю, в соло это не протащу, то я получу таким образом бесплатный экзит.  ценно потому что на бесплатный exit я назвал эту возможность но смотрите по они фактически фактически на себя берут роль инвесторов на все раунды на будущее то есть эти в моменте дают на тест если этот тест подтверждается звоните финансирует раунд если там метрики подтверждают что они финансируют следующий раунд если ты добегаешь до миллиона они тебе дают еще миллион на развитие миллион плюс а это уже нормальный ну ты Ну, там, не знаю, вплоть до Series A, да, вот на Series A ты можешь exit делать сам при желании, да, вот, но ты уже будешь exit с оценкой 10+, вот, и получать реальные бабки за свою долю.\\n- [20:32] The chunk is part of a conversation between Sergio Goriachev and Dmitriy Grankin discussing the development of a project related to trading and liquidity in the DeFi space. In this specific segment, Sergio outlines the initial steps needed to prepare a presentation, emphasizing the importance of marketing and the need to define features and hypotheses for the project.\\n  > Sergio Goriachev:  Короче, какие у нас тогда могут быть первые нормальные шаги?  С меня это презентажка.  Там просто, опять же, флоу.  Нужно подготовить нормальную презу, нормальную...  Там, не знаю, какие-то циферки накинуть и видео прессу.  Вот это я все сделаю.  Можем обсудить.  что-то по фичам каким-то первым и по первым гипотезам, что мы можем сделать, чтобы было что презентовать, типа «смотрите, первые 4К потратим сюда-сюда».  Ну, маркетинг.  Это 100% да, маркетинг.  Маркетинг и явно не реклама.\\n- [24:04] This chunk is part of a conversation between Sergio Goriachev and Dmitriy Grankin discussing the development of tools for digital nomads. They explore ideas for keyword research, potential product features, and strategies for generating traffic and engagement, while referencing a specific project called MyCraftMate as an example of a digital assistant for entrepreneurs.\\n  > Sergio Goriachev:  Да, это прикольно. То есть нам нужно придумать тулзы в контексте digital nomads.  на типа что они хотят делать это вот от запроса посмотреть что люди ищут То есть облако кевардов проресерчить, посмотреть, что там есть, гипотеза тулзов. И после этого уже Можно идти, ну вот в принципе вот и с этим, наверное, можно.  Потому что вот такие штуки, их можно сделать руками, это будет стоить.  условно-бесплатно, потому что ты можешь сделать руками.  Ну да, да, чипите что-то, она генерирует спокойненько.  Прикольно, прикольно, но...  Но, опять же, для преза нужно какое-то...  Вот я давай поширю, наверное, как это оформил Челик.  Я ему как раз комментировал, он сегодня обновил.  И забавно, что у него тоже фамилия Горячев.  Мы на первую встречу пришли, и такие, лол, встретились.  Так, вот сейчас.  Вот это вот...  У него проект называется MyCraftMate, что-то такое.  Это ассистент, опять же, который помогает...  ну, скажем, ИПшникам, да, тем, кто пытается сделать свой бизнес, да, монетизировать свои какие-то услуги, вот, и будет...  Бот помогает им цели декомпозировать как-то, их достигать, и вот это вот все.  Ну, и опять же, просто для примерчика, как это оформляется.  так куда смотреть на просто телегу да но это можешь презенташку глянуть Ну, понятно, да.  Да, ну, typical.  Но, соответственно, для этого нужна какая-то мейн-идея продукта.  Что это? ПК для меня это и ассистент, и опять же, это то, что им надо.  То есть видишь, такая идея как раз висит в списке идей SKL.  И ассистент для Digital Nomads, да, но что он делает, этот и ассистент, вот так вот.  Какая проблема у Digital Nomads есть, которую ты...  Ассистент решает.  Ну вот я бы начал  с keyword research и пришел бы к Каким-то гипотезам на эту тему.  Давай прямо это сделаем.  Я посмотрю Wordstat, посмотри по GPT.  Ай, чё там в Яксо думают?  Нужна тайна.  create a list of related keywords 50 at the Должен же быть какой-то use case для реал тайма.  Uh-huh.  А почему по-русски?  Они все русскоязычные.  Основательница, ну так, кто деньги привлекла, это Лиза Тищенко.  Она очень популярная девушка в VC.  Как раз 150 миллионов туда привлекло.  вот ключевые слова по функциональности timezone синхронизация прикольная кстати фигня простая и даже вот у нас сегодня ты говоришь 14 по лиссабону я Я пошел гуглить, думаю, блядь, у меня мозг еще этой хуйней нагружать.  Вот, Time Zone Synchronization, это прикольно.  Travel Planning, ну, на поверхности вязать.  Системы поверхности, financial tracking, интересно на самом деле, financial tracking для номадов, expense management неплохо.  Collaboration Tools тоже интересно, но, наверное, сложно.  Language Translation очень понятно.  Локал нетворкинг. Прикольно.  Так...  Ну да, вот это интересно.  Интересная наборка имвардов.  Тут еще Research от обычно Reddit на эту тему.  да там я видел даже штуки по фабрика контента и там будет идет смотреть топовые запросы в Вопросы в Reddit, готовят под них сценарии, готовят под них видос с озвучкой и заливают на YouTube.  Как ты говоришь.\\n- [31:36] This chunk is part of a conversation between Sergio Goriachev and Dmitriy Grankin discussing strategies for generating traffic and content ideas for a project aimed at digital nomads. They explore using popular topics from Reddit to create engaging content for platforms like YouTube Shorts and consider the feasibility of implementing these ideas through a Telegram bot.\\n  > Sergio Goriachev:  берется топик в реддите какой-то популярный берется в нем топ 10 запросов там они интересны это это это это вокруг этих запросов генерируются ответы соответственно по сценарию. Готовится сценарий, готовятся ответы, озвучивается, там накладывается какой-то видос, заливается в YouTube Shorts.  У тебя бесконечная фабрика трафика.  Да, я понял.  Да.  Очень клево.  Да, похоже на то, что ты говоришь. Какие-то чисто проблемные области.  Что-то такое common sense, не особо интересно.  Здесь надо прям выжимать find related reddit Ну вот, Digital Nomad, Solo Travels.  И все, что строяно всего.  Да, и это супер легко сделать в формате Telegram-бота для начала.  Окей, ладно, давай закруглимся.  Да, я подупакую это, скину на посмотреть, там какие идеи будут, кидай.  Посмотрим, что из этого всего получится.\\n\\n## Meeting 6 - December 04, 2024 15:32\\n\\n- [05:42] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and Jasper Vanuytrecht discussing a product related to meeting summaries and knowledge management. They explore features of the product, its user base, funding status, and client acquisition strategies, highlighting the importance of outreach and marketing efforts for growth.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  And after the meeting we got a dashboard like like this one which gives a summary and it gives a chat gpt style chat which can generate stuff based on a specific meeting or basically all the meetings as well.  What happened last week?  Tactic AI extension.  Tactic?  Yeah, I\\'ve been playing around with this one because it\\'s a pretty similar concept.  uh-huh but it\\'s putting this in Russian for some reason probably because I\\'ve got a lot of context in Russian no yeah Yeah, so the idea is basically to create knowledge that\\'s accessible in in charge of the key manner.  Okay.  And it\\'s it\\'s success.  both real time during the call and after the call yeah so it\\'s it\\'s more like  like a chat interface, no, instead of static reports, you can.  The idea is that like chat is, is, is kind of central thing.  But also the meetings and the filtering is that I can filter a subset of meetings and chart over this specific subset.  Like in a future release, it will be like you could just filter out your clients or team members.  numbers and chat over these ones all right kind of free trial  for the product yeah yeah you can you can go and uh  and use it full like a full version of it for free now because like payment is not implement  the theme is not implemented yet this feature is not yet delivered well it\\'s a good way to to get traction, to get some users.  Yeah.  To see how they perform.  Like it\\'s in the pipeline,  but for now it looks like it is a product that\\'s ready to to get some sales because uh there is a stable user base like with some people are using the product since early days for 500 meetings a few hundred victims there\\'s a few users like this and we got a stable influx of users every day like a few like two to five users daily with no marketing whatsoever yeah yeah I think it\\'s a solution for companies that have  of meetings and several people in the company, you know.  So do you have your VC backed or was it the previous group?  yeah it\\'s VC backed like I\\'ve raised some angel investment mm-hmm Now this year Okay, and I think we\\'ll be able probably be able to to go this way up to serious a maybe all right you said you have clients like new clients they go from your existing  network community like all warm no not really for now these are the clients that are coming with  empty utms which which basically means it\\'s a direct uh customer directly referenced by someone i oh yeah yeah referenced right yes i don\\'t i don\\'t see the reference itself because oh yeah yeah referenced right yes i don\\'t i don\\'t see the reference itself because  but you\\'re not doing like uh outreach to businesses to offer the trial or to talk to them about yeah how they are doing their meetings currently you know they\\'re sharing\\n- [11:33] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and Jasper Vanuytrecht, where Dmitry discusses the challenges of balancing product development with marketing and sales efforts in a startup environment. He reflects on his experiences with hiring a product manager, the difficulties of effective communication, and the importance of understanding the target audience for successful marketing strategies.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  I had a few campaigns, let\\'s say, like we had LinkedIn outreach campaign this summer then we had product hunt release and we had a Brazilian influencer integration and yeah it looks like all these things are working uh and for now i don\\'t Don\\'t take any marketing effort rather than speaking to you and to my immediate network.  uh for because i\\'ve been busy building the product the last few weeks and now the product is live in the dashboard the the the thing that we\\'re having after the meeting is we\\'ve been rebuilt in heaven it\\'s difficult to do all the also  marketing and sales if your founder working on the product right and In the meantime, you also need customers, but you have to do a little bit of everything.  Yes, but the thing is that you basically, You cannot...  These things are really difficult to...  to hire someone to do for you i had a product manager and the thing was that we\\'ve been you know speaking with your for a couple of hours daily and this is a sunk time cost right these two hours and and she was talking to people and obviously i lose a lot of information while she speaks to people not me so basically I lose money to pay her her job I lose information because she is doing these things and I lose time when trying to communicate with here and same thing happens with the development team as well So the thing is that you\\'d better do everything yourself if you could, and to delegate things that are quite specific quite specific so this product who you were working with product manager  but she was working with the product maybe talking to some people but she was not doing a marketing or sales for you she\\'s been doing marketing as well but she\\'s  working as product manager, then we switched, she started doing marketing, but she was not me, you know.  And I don\\'t say I\\'m better than you in all the ways, but the thing is that I am the founder and as a founder, you basically need to probably delegate things that you already know by hand you know things that that there There is something you understand what you want to achieve from this or that specific tool or mechanism.  Um, yeah, that\\'s why for now I\\'d rather work with professionals who know specific like marketing mechanism.  who know how to whatever they\\'re a good like a good experience was working with it with the girl who delivered this Brazilian influencer integration because this guy doesn\\'t speak English at all.  I have no choice to address that audience because I don\\'t speak their language, I don\\'t share their mindset.  and i even can\\'t communicate with this guy because we have their direct connection but we just don\\'t understand each other i\\'d better speak uh portuguese with him try to speak rather than he would speak english to me because so these things really work so she she\\'s she\\'s done a job I couldn\\'t deliver at all yeah yeah there\\'s a different ways of marketing of course influencer  The marketing now is working pretty well, but of course you need to move with on the right audience, you know, you have to know who are your ideal customers that you your solution and then basically just engage with this segment in the market how does the sales if you\\'re a super early stage company like you it\\'s ideal that you can have conversations with like potential customers right um that you are like the the the the the first person like to talk to you know because you know your company best and the product and everything but always a challenge with the founders I see is that, yeah, they have to do so many things so they don\\'t have time for sales and they do a little bit of sales or then they hire an agency to do it for them, but then, There\\'s never the results that you pay for.  So actually you want to do it yourself, but also you don\\'t have time to do it yourself.\\n- [20:31] This chunk is part of a conversation between Jasper Vanuytrecht and Dmitry Grankin, where Jasper provides feedback on Dmitry\\'s product demo, discussing the importance of identifying target customers and crafting effective outreach messages. He emphasizes the need for a strategic approach to sales and marketing, particularly for tools that address enterprise privacy and knowledge management challenges.\\n  > Jasper Vanuytrecht:  Yes, I think for sure. I mean, I see the product you did the demo and it looks really good. You know, it\\'s like I was impressed. I\\'m sure you can sell this.  I think it\\'s just a matter of knowing who needs the solution most, who has this problem that you solve.  So this is all like strategy and this is the basis for the good sales go to market.  Once you have that, you can find for instance you can think about a really good message like when you do send an email or you send a LinkedIn message to this perfect client you know what What you always have to say is like, you make like a personal observation about them that is relevant to a certain business problem that they are struggling with.  So it will be immediately it gets their attention and then you basically say that you solve this in this way without really pitching your in your company you know so how you solve this and in the in the third part of the message if you can also convey why you are better than competition for this specific customer this is also really compelling for them so they know okay they are better than grain because this isn\\'t isn\\'t this or they better than fireflies because of this you know for us that\\'s why you\\'re are unique and then lastly you do call to action so you offer them something really interesting so they will take an action or is maybe meeting with you or is trying the product free trial or maybe downloads whatever kind of a marketing piece you know and this is how you can auto this this works you automate it consistently you\\'re getting leads leads and customers and this will obviously help you grow and get you to the series b yeah uh i think um there is a uh  Establishing a establishing market for these kind of tools.  So there is something that obviously has got demand and the problem the problem is people just want to to store the information basically store they even don\\'t don\\'t need that much to access it sometimes but they want to want to store it as a matter of fact and so there is a market and there is is a problem and for enterprises is a problem they can\\'t use it because of their own privacy and security policy.  In order to work on this, the solution is to have this thing deployed locally in premises.  And then the vision of the product comes in, which is...  You build knowledge while speaking to customers and team members and not only you about the entire company and those who need this knowledge most have instant access to it it\\'s like everybody is contributing to just by doing the things that they naturally do, just speaking to people, pitching their ideas.  And why is that cool?  is that people tend to naturally share more while verbally you know on meetings and come up with more creative things to to deliver there to share uh to share the things and you have it for for basically you like uh You have it for free in a chat interface.  Same thing as you would have with ChatGPTO or publicly available.  data you have something for your own gated knowledge which is much much more  valuable\\n- [25:15] This chunk is part of a conversation between Jasper Vanuytrecht and Dmitry Grankin, where Jasper discusses the importance of outreach messages and use cases in sales strategy. He offers his consulting services to help business owners develop effective sales strategies, emphasizing the need for personalized support and implementation guidance. The discussion also touches on the costs associated with his services and the challenges of balancing product development with sales efforts.\\n  > Jasper Vanuytrecht:  That\\'s, I think, important to mention also in every conversation with such a client, you know, and so in the outreach messages, So, yeah, I think Yeah, and then  Sorry, yeah, just dropped Then comes obviously comes use cases And the slot of use cases use cases which we don\\'t have a good understanding which like marketing research like you can can make it like one from marketing research who are competitors what people say about this company about this product performance All of our team members are more into this and that technology, this and that idea.  about crypto or whatever yeah yeah well if  again like if you\\'re planning to do the sales yourself you\\'re not going to hire like a lead generation agency you\\'re not going to like hire salespeople like it\\'s very expensive like you know the salaries you know sales commission or especially the lead generation agencies they charge maybe every month for okay so if you want to have like better like a strategy that you can do the sales but in a very effective way, I can help you with that. And my offer is very, it\\'s very simple. So I always work with business owners, like one session per week of more or less two hours we do four to five sessions so it\\'s like more or less one month and with all this you You will get the strategy and you know exactly which tools you can use to generate new clients, you know.  And during all this time, I\\'m like your, support you know um you can always ask me questions i will help it\\'s not just like sessions or workshop sessions but i can help you on the go you have we have like collaborative documents uh we have the slides we have yeah help with the implementation execution of everything so all this together um to give you an idea of what it what it might cost if you\\'re if you\\'re interested um it ranges uh so the various the minimum it\\'s like 2k the maximum is 5k so the bigger companies they more or less but about 5k they usually need more sessions so it\\'s The amount of session that defines it, but you can, you can do it for.  For the lower ends of the, of the range to, to give you an idea.  I tried the same thing where I had one session with a friend of mine about this was the same concept. It didn\\'t work just because I just didn\\'t have time for implementation, just didn\\'t have resources. Basically that Yeah, that\\'s it, and I went building the product.  Yeah.  So...  it might happen is that I feel like at some point in time, if I feel like I\\'m dedicated to it right now for, Yeah, or a week or two and then go for it. I need My guidance say but it would not work on a monthly basis.  phases obviously because i need to switch back and forth between things\\n- [29:50] This chunk is part of a conversation between Jasper Vanuytrecht and Dmitry Grankin, where they discuss the importance of having a sales strategy and execution for startups. Jasper emphasizes the need for founders to take action on sales and marketing to avoid dependency on external partners, while also highlighting the value of the knowledge and strategies he offers in his training program. The discussion transitions towards marketing strategies, including the potential use of SEO tools.\\n  > Jasper Vanuytrecht:  yeah i mean it it\\'s also very expensive to do every month pay for leads you know um because What is the most important that you have insights in the company you have a process that you can Execute and that makes use the sales helps you with doing the sales Otherwise, you become dependent on external partners.  But of course, when you learn something, you learn a strategy as a founder.  you have to really execute it you know you have to take action because if you\\'re not going to do anything of sales and marketing or in some point you\\'re investments they you have less runway at some point so you need customers this is also always saying start new cooperation like look this project success depends 50 on you also it\\'s not not 100 on me as the trainer you know because if you do not execute what i teach you or what we learn this is not it\\'s going to have zero value for you because you will not get any sales from it you know so this is of course very important aspect of this kind of cooperation but when they do when they when they work you see immediately like within a few weeks after completing program even sometimes during the program they start between the workshops they already start executing everything everything they learn they\\'re already generating the leads and they book like twice as much meetings with potential clients every week so this is what we What we want to see is results with the clients that they have more meetings, more sales opportunities.  But yeah, often it\\'s really a matter.  of the knowledge you know and the strategy and yeah i i i did like 10 years only doing focusing on that you know So it\\'s so much testing, trial and error, all this knowledge, all this time.  You can download this, you know, in one month and then you have all the knowledge.  that you can use to to be successful that\\'s the that is the the goal yeah  Okay, I think at some point when I got to the The idea I need to do the outreach and start digging into it. Yeah I\\'ll start I\\'ll start you know, I\\'ll reach you out Mm-hmm  Yes, because I think your time for now, I\\'m,  you know, I\\'m looking at other things.  I am just after heavy coding.  time a lot of coding and now i get some back reports on the things and the division uh that users are, you know, updating my understanding of what they want to build.  And next thing.  I think in terms of marketing, I think that I would rather go for some kind of SEO tool.\\n\\n## Meeting 13 - December 10, 2024 11:01\\n\\n- [10:06] In a conversation between Waqas Arshad and Dmitry Grankin about the marketing strategies for a new AI transcription tool, Waqas emphasizes the importance of product-led SEO as a long-term strategy to attract users by addressing their specific problems, contrasting it with short-term tactics like PPC and influencer marketing.\\n  > Waqas Arshad:  So we call it as a product led SEO.  SEO so that focuses on writing content for the users who are actually looking for the product who are having a problem in actually getting transcriptions or recording of the meeting or AI based speech recognition and the transcription of the meeting notes.  So these kinds of problems.  So they are actually writing topics, covering those problems and giving their product The solution, so that when someone comes and reads that content piece, first of all, they\\'ll find the solution to the problem and then they will naturally see that, okay, VEXA AI actually solved my problem, okay, let me try it out.  So it will be acting as a natural lead magnet for you, right?  So it\\'s a long-term thing.  You definitely need to work on that as your competitors are also doing.  And if you don\\'t go towards SEO and you just focus on Captera, GE2 or PPC or influencer marketer, obviously you\\'ll get quick results, you will get short term results, you will get short term leads, but in the longer run, And whenever you stop paying them, your traffic would fall down and you\\'ll not be having a steady inflow of users onto your website.  So cutting it short, it should be a very balanced approach where you should focus on SEO as well as you should build a short-term strategy, let it be PPC, let it be influencer marketing, let it be other platforms like G2 Capital. So I\\'m not saying don\\'t go that way.  But it has to be a balanced approach.  So you take both of these side by side so that one chunking is going toward a short-term goal and then one chunk is going towards a long-term plan.\\n- [13:07] This chunk is part of a conversation between Waqas Arshad and Dmitry Grankin, where Waqas discusses strategies for content creation and SEO specifically tailored for SaaS companies. He emphasizes the importance of understanding the product\\'s value propositions and target audience (ICP) to effectively select topics for blog content. The dialogue also explores the significance of generating leads through relevant content rather than just focusing on traffic, and it outlines a structured approach to content marketing that includes different stages of the buyer\\'s journey.\\n  > Waqas Arshad:  this concept so this is the main thing that i would like you to actually explore and this is what we are specializing in so we work with SaaS companies like you and we help you then manage their blog section so it\\'s not just uh seeing what your competitor is doing pick up the topic put that into the ai tool generate the content and publish so it\\'s not how this works Very specialized thing that needs to be done with the specific understanding where your product stands, what are your value propositions, what is your ICP, and then based upon that, we do the topic selection.  and then once topic is selected then content is crafted with proper in-depth competitor analysis right so this is a complete process that we take and we help our SaaS clients managing the blog section.  So is this something that you think you would like to explore?  Is this something you would like to go towards?  Yes, yes, I\\'ll be doing that.  That\\'s for sure.  I\\'ll be doing that, but my vision is that text is something that can be and should be done and everybody is making these pages a blog.  But also there is something that is an idea of micro-SaaS or SEO tools, is that something You create a service that is related to your main product, which is coming from something that people are...  searching for life.  Can you, I actually couldn\\'t get your point here.  Can you please repeat that for me?  Yes, I mean that it\\'s like the,  example is like tactic is getting a traffic from YouTube for how to get transcripts from you How to get transcripts from YouTube is something that you can get this transcript just from a single API call.  So they are just delivering this value instead of writing a blog post.  They are just giving this transcript.  to the user and they use a combination of contact marketing, influence marketing, just saying, hey, you need this YouTube transcripts here is how to get them all six attached just go and visit this page and get your transcripts that\\'s it and it\\'s generating traffic which is a candle related possibly related to what they\\'ve been delivering as a main product it\\'s always converting yeah there is uh i now get your point so what you\\'re saying  Suggesting is we focus on topics that we can also made a YouTube video on.  So we build a video on YouTube and then the traffic that comes from that particular video, we Redirected to our page on the website, right? That\\'s what you were telling.  Yeah, I mean something that there is a lot of related things like how to transcribe a video, how to transcribe an audio, how to how to summarize YouTube video, whatever.  A lot of things that are related and you can basically just land them to the uh you know to the portal as a result with this content so well uh  i now understand your point dimitri the point here is there can be endless possibilities on what we can do right but in order to give you a little direction what\\'s what would be the main starting point is first of all We will have to actually understand the main features that what your product is actually providing. So we\\'ll list those main features that okay, these are the main problems that your product is solving. These are the main key features that your product is having right now.  So we\\'ll prepare a list for that.  Then we\\'ll be creating an ICP.  So we\\'ll have a discussion with you and we\\'ll figure out what is your main target ICP. So what are your main prospects look like?  Once we have that information, then we\\'ll be actually figuring out the topics that are actually related to your ICP and to your features.  So if we go that way, the selection of topic would be very much relevant to your product first thing and then it will be actually addressing the problems your ict is having so right now the suggestion that you\\'re giving me it can be related to your product or maybe it\\'s totally irrelevant So once we have done this activity and then the selection of topic is done, only then we can make sure that the people who are landing onto your website are actually interested in the product.  Otherwise there are endless possibilities the topics that we can write on and it doesn\\'t give you any results so at the end of the day any content piece that you write any video that you create the main goal is to actually generate leads is actually to find people who are actually by the product, right?  So the main goal is not getting traffic.  So let\\'s say you have 1 million traffic on the website and no one is converting, it\\'s of no use to you.  But if you have 10,000 highly targeted people landing onto your website and which are actually converting that is more relevant to you so selection of the keyword is very important it\\'s it\\'s just the one approach uh which is yeah  yes which is basically to to find a traffic that will convert to a specific product uh the other one is more like in search for a value proposition given the technology stack and the thing that not the uh value proposition we are having now but something that product could potentially do like the uh the technology and the starting backward starting from what people are actually searching for yeah exactly there are  basically three categories of the contents a large amount of trust  from there and trying to acquire this traffic and see how to actually convert it into sales with the technology we have.  Because the technology can be repositioned in a myriad of ways.  And I would also be interested to explore this approach as well, starting backwards.  what people are actually searching related to potentially the technology stack i am having  yeah so basically let me give you a little bit more idea about how these things work so there are three Major categories of the content that we work on so top of the funnel middle of the funnel and the bottom of the funnel topics so top of the funnel are the topics which are actually providing information about the product so maybe.  How does meeting assistant works?  What is meeting assistant, how to proscribe, how to do the transcription, these kinds of informative topics, then there are bottle on the bottom of the funding here are the bottom of the middle of the funnel are the people who are actually a little more towards the buyer journey.  So they do know about the product, they do know about the problem, they are exploring the bottom of the funnel. These are the keywords which are commercial in nature. So these are the keywords where people are actually planning to make a decision. They are they are a purchase right so it will be a complete combination of these three type of topics so top of the funnel informative pieces but middle of the funnel and then the bottom of the funnel so it will be a complete mix so it\\'s not just one type of topics, those will be the queries that are informative, then decision making, and then the final commercial topics as well.  So it can be a complete combination of that.  I understand this concept.  OK, yes.\\n- [25:26] This chunk occurs during a discussion between Waqas Arshad and Dmitry Grankin about content creation strategies for Dmitry\\'s AI tool. Waqas emphasizes the importance of quality content and the limitations of relying solely on AI for content generation, while Dmitry expresses his interest in potentially outsourcing content creation. The conversation highlights the need for a balanced approach that combines manual processes with AI assistance to ensure effective content marketing.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  need to dedicate some specific time for doing that the other idea is that you are suggesting is that just fully just fully fully outsource this thing or if that\\'s a full outsourcing okay just uh give me an idea what what\\'s going to look like okay because otherwise i have a clear idea how to uh how to proceed doing this myself in a kind of smart way which could be very dumb way as well we don\\'t yeah  Dimitri, I would say you already have an AI tool that you have custom built.  So I must say that you are very much aware about the AI and the advent of AI in this niche.  I would like to add a few things here.  AI is a very good tool if you use it, obviously you know that, but if you talk about content that we are writing and publishing for the sake of convergence and for the sake of Google to actually recognize recognize it as an authority we can\\'t completely rely on ai ai can be used as an assistant but completely relying for example if we select if we use air for the selection of a topic.  We can\\'t make sure that the topic that AI is providing is relevant, right or not, was first thing.  Secondly, the main thing before we actually write a content is devising a proper content brief.  So a proper content outline has to be prepared so that we do know what\\'s the main intent of the user with that query and what our main goal is in order for before we actually write the article. So what our goal is from that content is, but that has to be outlined first.  So if we use AI to create outlines, AI doesn\\'t create very good outlines. So it\\'s our experience and we have been talking with clients in the market.  So AI doesn\\'t create very good outlines.  It has to be a very manual process.  So if you do it manually or with using AI, you can create tens of outlines within two, three hours.  But what process we follow?  It takes us like three, four hours to just create one content outline because the art process is completely manual and we have to actually read the articles that are ranking for that particular key.  So, I mean, We do utilize AI, but we can\\'t completely rely on that.  Thirdly, once the outline is done, content writing is something we can do very good writing using AI, but again, don\\'t properly humanize the content and if the content is not optimized as for the latest Google algorithms, it\\'s not going to work.  Google is very smart.  It actually identifies the content, which is a return.  Not even writers who are actually very much aware of how to use AI tools or GPT or any other tool, they simply read it and they can even identify that it\\'s not a human content or it\\'s an AI written one.  Yeah, I got your point. We don\\'t have that much time, so tell me one thing. Who is actually doing that?  No, no. I have a complete team in my company. So there is an SEO specialist.  I have a team of writers and then editors as well. So the best way to go is to go to the SEO specialist.  go forward with i was just explaining this because uh just to let you know our composite is completely manual and it\\'s not focused on completely doing it automatically so it takes us like three four days to just craft one content piece that we submit. So our main focus is quality, not quantity.\\n- [30:22] This chunk occurs during a conversation between Waqas Arshad and Dmitry Grankin, where Waqas discusses the importance of targeting interested users and converting them through high-quality content. He proposes a trial for content creation to demonstrate the value of their services compared to cheaper alternatives, emphasizing the long-term benefits of quality over quantity in SEO and content marketing strategies.\\n  > Waqas Arshad:  Their major focus is to only target the users which are interested and then convert convert them. So based upon the services and based upon the value proposition that we have, I believe our pricing is very much cost effective. And as for the main leaders in the market,  yeah okay i have a proposition for you by the way  you can try out i mean the people who are cheap in the market in the market and just try one article with me you can do a trial with me we can do paid trial with one article alone where we do a topic selection for your brand and write the content and then you can publish it and you can try provide some other chief agency as well and you\\'ll have a benchmark of the quality that they are providing and what we are providing and then only then you will be able to actually feel the difference in what we have to offer and what other companies who are charging less are happening to you. Otherwise, it\\'s just discussion that we\\'re having. Maybe you can simply say he\\'s just making blame excuses. He\\'s just making claims and they\\'re not doing something different. So only you can only figure out once you out once you try and benchmark it with some other service that are cheap i would say do a trial with me and do a trial with another company and then you can figure it out yeah okay  Okay. Okay. We\\'ll get back to it. By the way, do you use Google Meet as your primary meeting app?  Yeah, we use Google Meet a lot, but we\\'re not only using that.  We use Zoom as well.  We are using Microsoft Teams as well.  So, it\\'s totally based upon what is the preference from the client.  And do you say any of the note takers available in the market?  As of yet, I\\'m not using any of them, but I do plan to use going forward.  Okay.  Um, so the use case I\\'ve been, uh, you have a non.  this specific call with you now is that I\\'ve been I\\'ve been checking the numbers Four pieces of content, 8, 6, 22, and the price is something I\\'ve missed by ear.  and that\\'s something that I have and now I can do something like summarize the proposition So the proposition is content creation focus on high quality competitor analysis is your strategy.  the proposition the pricing I am so so that is uh something that can be done real time during the call and there\\'s much much more after the call that\\'s come down so So I encourage you to try it out, too.  It\\'s free.  Yeah, definitely.  I can give it a try and see what we can do.  uh uh but what are your thoughts i believe you found the pricing to be very high as for your  budget right yes i i was feeling like uh is that like 150 bucks per article is something considered and considered pretty high  there was a time when i used to feel the same but once i get into this and the quality if you focus on quality There are companies which charge $1,200 for just one article.  There are companies in the market.  The main thing is what actually you are targeting at.  You\\'re having a SaaS product.  and you want to make sure that your SaaS is recognized as an authority in your niche.  In order to do that, you need to actually focus on quality.  If you actually compromise on the quality and go towards quantity and go towards cheap SEO and cheap agencies, it will definitely, uh, fired back down the road because for one instance, you try a cheap SEO and you focus on quality quantity and you publish like 50, 80 or a hundred content.  10 pieces in a year or in like six months.  And then you actually realize, okay, it\\'s not working out.  I\\'m actually getting some traffic, but it\\'s not giving me any benefit.  We were at the end of the day, a million traffic on a website.  Like Alexa.ai is not going to benefit if it\\'s not converting, right?  1000 traffic, which converted more value.  If you want to make it right at that point of Time it\\'s going to cost you double because 100 content pieces that are already published should be revised again. A new SEO company will come and will do a complete audit on your content, will figure out what topics to retain, what topics to remove, It will take time.  Then they\\'ll have to update the content and it\\'s gonna cost you twice the money that you\\'re gonna do it if you focus just on quality.\\n- [36:01] This chunk is part of a conversation between Waqas Arshad and Dmitry Grankin, where Waqas provides strategic advice on content marketing for Dmitry\\'s SaaS product. He emphasizes the importance of focusing on high-quality content over quantity, discusses the relevance of targeted traffic in the SaaS industry, and suggests conducting trials with different content creation agencies to evaluate effectiveness and pricing.\\n  > Waqas Arshad:  So my suggestion to you would be just focus on quality content content if you don\\'t have budget for like four articles of a month just do two if you don\\'t have budget for two just do one it should be high quality don\\'t go towards quantity don\\'t go towards cheap seo i would say Search for the market leaders in the SEO and see what they have to say.  Traffic is just a vanity these days.  People, especially in the SaaS industry, they\\'re not looking for traffic.  They say, we don\\'t want traffic on our website.  We only want people who want our product because that\\'s the main goal.  We are here to sell.  We are not here to give any public service and they\\'re not running ads or they are not doing any affiliate marketing on the website.  So any traffic is not relevant.  they only want people who are interested so that\\'s a very important thing that you need to consider and from my side i would i can only say before you opt you can try I on a free or on a trial with us.  And one trial with me, one trial with any other chief agency, do a benchmark on maybe as you are aware of AI, you can produce one content on your own using AI and see what\\'s the difference, which one performs better.  And then only then you can actually figure out of the pricing that I\\'m quoting  is actually, uh, expensive or is it cost effective?  So, uh, I\\'ll share some case studies with you that.  have published you can have a look upon what our customers have seen and then maybe at that point  you can decide if it\\'s something that you would like to buy or not okay thank you very much  with me your uh yeah the portfolio the things that you want to share with  yeah sure thing i\\'ll drop it after the call on your linkedin chat and  i\\'ll be looking forward to your response okay thank you very much have a nice day\\n\\n## Meeting 14 - December 11, 2024 18:31\\n\\n- [00:00] This chunk is part of a conversation between Lara Vargas and Dmitriy Grankin, where Lara discusses a recent incident involving windows falling from a building, expressing concern about the construction quality. The dialogue transitions into a discussion about marketing strategies and influencer outreach.\\n  > Lara Vargas:  the code uh that\\'s what the the fire brigade said maybe the code made the glasses uh change the the you know the the structure and so they fell on the street it was it was a bit scary but thankfully everything is settled now they had to come in and and change everything it\\'s pretty strange that windows just fall out of the building  yes apparently it had already happened to  other people before in this in the building oh yeah yeah okay so so i think it\\'s it\\'s uh the way that it was built it was bad yeah i don\\'t know some mistakes in the construction or yeah yeah anyway that yeah i also had\\n- [01:35] This chunk occurs early in a conversation between Dmitriy Grankin and Lara Vargas, where they discuss technical issues with their video connection before transitioning into a discussion about influencer marketing strategies.\\n  > Dmitriy Grankin:  unstable is it yeah i can hear you well i can see um some lagging in the video in the video i\\'m not sure why is it the connection or it\\'s performance issue yeah but it\\'s okay okay who\\'s gonna start Yeah, I\\'ve got I\\'ve been exploring some ideas about this influence marketing Okay, so you can go ahead because my  hey my internet\\'s a bit bad so i would rather let you start\\n- [02:00] The chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitriy Grankin and Lara Vargas discussing strategies for influencer marketing, specifically focusing on engaging micro-influencers with up to 10,000 subscribers to promote their product, VEXA.\\n  > Dmitriy Grankin:  than i can yeah um my ideas were about this micro influencers and engaging with those that are up to 10,000 subscribers maybe.  Now, those who are posting about some specific, some specific request.\\n- [02:24] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitriy Grankin and Lara Vargas discussing strategies for influencer marketing, specifically focusing on outreach methods for engaging micro-influencers related to tools like Trello and Jira for content creation.\\n  > Dmitriy Grankin:  I\\'ve created a bunch of requests that were about how to set up Trello, Jira and stuff around.  the pipeline when you put in the target requests and get influencers and bloggers names where you\\'re going to manually outreach them about doing something together in terms of content creation.  so basically the idea is to outreach those guys via LinkedIn possibly and And I think that making 100 of those outreaches would bring some.  to some results.  Okay, sounds good.\\n- [04:07] This chunk occurs during a discussion between Dmitriy Grankin and Lara Vargas about influencer marketing strategies, specifically focusing on micro-influencers and their niche expertise. They explore the potential of engaging with influencers who have specific domain knowledge, such as using tools like Jira and Trello, and inquire about Vext\\'s integrations with these platforms.\\n  > Dmitriy Grankin:  Yeah, and the perspective of these guys is also something that\\'s a pretty valuable thing because they got their audience they\\'ve got their specific niche use case because if they are posting about setting up jira for whatever reason they are possibly sourcing sourcing clients from this so that\\'s something about But their domain expertise is somewhere around that, so it\\'s an interesting source of business use case.  Okay, so I remember that Olia had told me that Vext has an integration with Trello, does it also have with Jira?  No, we don\\'t have any integrations for now.  Okay.\\n- [05:01] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitriy Grankin and Lara Vargas discussing strategies for influencer marketing and content creation for Vexa. Dmitriy expresses the need to identify influencers who can effectively communicate Vexa\\'s value to their audiences, highlighting his uncertainty about the ideal customer profile and the importance of engaging with domain experts.\\n  > Dmitriy Grankin:  But the idea is just to find an influencer who will be interested in explaining Vexa to their audience basically or even if not it\\'s an interesting source of domain information.  It\\'s like talking to these guys who bring a lot of generalized information from their specific niches they are in because like I am very I understand I have been very local about my ideas How to market this thing, how to position this thing, and who is my ideal customer?  I just basically have no idea who is my ideal.\\n- [09:22] This chunk is part of a conversation between Lara Vargas and Dmitriy Grankin, where Lara discusses ideas for utilizing the VEXA tool in innovative ways beyond its traditional use. She specifically focuses on applications for coaches to enhance communication feedback and outlines potential social media strategies for promoting these ideas.\\n  > Lara Vargas:  Yeah, so from what I gathered from our conversation last week, the briefing was think about ways to think to make VEXA a useful tool outside the...  usual way of use, think about tips and tricks to use it, to make content around it, and make research and About what type of different uses that would be.  So I brought a few that I thought about.  And so the first one would be a training Feedback for communication, so for example, people that are coaches, career coaches, you know, that they can use VEXA for their clients.  when they are in coaching their clients really, and then they can use a transcription to analyze how the person communicates during the meetings, look for, patterns and their communication as, for example, if they use some kind of excessive terms or if they interrupt sometimes how efficient the message is that they are transcribing and then sorry okay okay yeah go ahead and then add the social media that i would focus for this specific The specific target would be LinkedIn and Instagram.  The strategy would be short videos, visual testimonials and carousel.\\n- [11:00] This chunk is part of a conversation between Lara Vargas and Dmitriy Grankin discussing potential use cases for VEXA, a tool for transcription and analysis. In this specific segment, Lara outlines how VEXA can be utilized in qualitative research, emphasizing its benefits for companies conducting interviews and the efficiency it brings by allowing users to analyze transcriptions instead of repeatedly listening to recordings.\\n  > Lara Vargas:  The second use case would be qualitative research.  So there is a few companies that do qualitative research So they have to make interviews and that is also a really good way of using VEXA because then they can have the transcription, and lots of times when you use a when you do qualitative research you make a recording that you have to listen to over and over again so vexa would do a very good way to to not have to go through the recording again you would just have to go through the transcription and then analyze it so a few quality  search you mean uh what what\\'s the you you mean uh those guys who are listening to conversations by by other people yeah like yeah like uh like specialized marketing companies that\\'s  specialized in research for other companies.\\n- [12:39] This chunk is part of a conversation between Lara Vargas and Dmitriy Grankin discussing the potential applications of VEXA, a transcription tool, in various business contexts. Specifically, Lara is explaining how VEXA could be utilized in qualitative research, particularly in focus groups for product launches, highlighting its usefulness in analyzing participant feedback.\\n  > Lara Vargas:  So for example, if there is a big, a large company that wants to launch a product, and so they will make a focus group about that product you know yes so they will ask that focus group what they think about that product that normally happens with a record regarding that they make an interview with the person about what they think of the product.  So Vaxxer could be a really good use.  It\\'s the kind of product\\n- [13:08] This chunk occurs during a discussion between Dmitriy Grankin and Lara Vargas about strategies for influencer marketing and product management. Dmitriy is seeking clarification on the specific mechanics and processes involved in their outreach efforts, particularly in relation to customer development interviews and the overall pipeline for their marketing initiatives.\\n  > Dmitriy Grankin:  product management this is what we call product management where you engage in a lot of customer development interviews yes or Okay, so do you have specific ideas about mechanics of achieving this?  uh just right after do you really do you really know what you\\'re going to do like the mechanics like you go to this or that website and you do this for inactions and then like what\\'s the pipeline  so i wanted to first talk to you to see which one of those you thought was best to focus on um i have i have other ones as well\\n- [14:16] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitriy Grankin and Lara Vargas discussing strategies for influencer marketing and outreach. Dmitriy emphasizes the importance of creating efficient pipelines for outreach on platforms like LinkedIn and YouTube, and he mentions using code to automate the process of identifying potential influencers. The discussion also includes brainstorming various audience segments to target for their marketing efforts.\\n  > Dmitriy Grankin:  yeah um i like from the very beginning beginning to create pipelines that would make life much easier in terms of routines because outreaching someone you have a weak idea about LinkedIn is a pretty scary thing.  You just go to LinkedIn and you, you die there, right?  Because it\\'s a social network and something.  going on there and you have a vague idea what you\\'re what you\\'re actually doing there so that\\'s why uh this pipeline or other pipeline Like this, I mentioned. I just created a piece of code, which you drop in, like, how you put it.  this qualitative research specialist or you do it the other way. You would ask chat GPT about what is the likely that those guys would look on YouTube, Quantitative Research Specialist, right?  What would they be looking for on YouTube?  then you got a bunch of requests each of those you just drop in into into this piece of code to get nano-influencer\\'s LinkedIn address.  linkedin or address or a name then you would then have to this specific name and go and check the content on linkedin and and outreach linkedin but at least at this point you are you have very specific things to do and if you have other pipelines like this uh so that you first you develop a system which is easy to develop and easy to to use actually yeah yeah otherwise it\\'s um yeah it\\'s uh just a matter of luck whether it will work this one it\\'s Quantitative. Quantitative research to this, you know.  Yeah, okay. I actually brought other several ideas of audiences to target because from my understanding that was the idea like bring different ways to use So what I tried to do was bring in lots of different ways.  And so we would choose a few to focus on.\\n- [20:30] This chunk occurs during a discussion between Lara Vargas and Dmitriy Grankin about strategies for influencer marketing and content creation for VEXA. Lara is seeking clarification on the next steps in their collaborative efforts after sharing her ideas and suggestions for using VEXA in various contexts.\\n  > Lara Vargas:  so uh what do you feel the next step should be i am now that\\'s what i\\'ve been doing now\\n- [23:34] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitriy Grankin and Lara Vargas discussing strategies for influencer outreach and content creation related to VEXA, a tool for project management. Dmitriy shares a piece of code intended to help identify and contact potential influencers on YouTube, while Lara seeks clarification on the content focus and types of engagements they should target. The dialogue emphasizes the importance of understanding the audience and refining their outreach approach.\\n  > Dmitriy Grankin:  I was just piece of I\\'ll share with you a piece of code Don\\'t know if you can see much here. Yeah, I mean it\\'s a code yeah this is the right code right so So here it is. So we\\'ve got we\\'ve got Search with channels how to stop Trello for product manager Management and here I\\'m going and to get I got the results and I got 10 videos with channels and description channel channel info title description and hopefully somewhere here we\\'ve got their contact information like they\\'ve got this Instagram gmail business contact that\\'s what they shared in their in their channel Description, yeah Yeah, so maybe the easiest way would be just to first to come up with the list of like a list of user profiles and then to generate a list of their possible cures that they will be likely making on youtube and then uh parsing those channels that were created content recently with a not that huge amount of views and parse uh their contact information from those and that will be already like the list basically a list of contacts you are automatically getting a list of contacts so that the the manual part comes in the manual part is that you go and you outreach The next part is basically to set up a meeting.  To set up a meeting in order to talk to them. Basically, this is the result itself.  which is already a lot of information from this meeting possibly if we if we\\'re talking about something that we for sure would understand if there is anything about this at all if we are in the same share share at least some common ground at all if we do share then it\\'s a win if we don\\'t it\\'s already it\\'s also an information a lot of information okay right so we should  really start i should really start reaching out to the people regarding the Project management.  We don\\'t know, because it\\'s just a piece of text that we\\'re putting into the system.  system uh how to set up trello for product management you can you you can put whatever request like how to uh how to make a paper ship right and it will work the same way okay  I don\\'t know if I understand this last part about the code, because do you want me to use to be using this code for the for the next steps as well uh using this code i don\\'t think  it will work and i don\\'t think it\\'s possible uh think that maybe would go the other way is that we just I\\'ll just put a bunch of contacts out of it okay yeah so tell me if it\\'s so funny interested there\\'s something about that you\\'ll be interested to do it all because yeah  sorry what did what i don\\'t don\\'t understand yeah i\\'m tell me  if it\\'s if you are interested at all about uh doing doing this thing  yeah i am i just i just don\\'t understand uh what you mean because um You are, so you are showing me this piece of code and then through this piece of code you plan on getting the code.  contact information of the people on youtube so you can afterwards reach out to them to make videos with them but um the in terms of the the content that they promote.  That\\'s what is in my mind.  I don\\'t understand what type of content you want to focus on.  Do you think that we should just Por exemplo, a lista que eu tenho aqui. Talvez eu possa compartilhar com vocês também.  Oh, mas desculpe, está em português. Eu posso compartilhar com vocês mais tarde.  So I have a few different options.  For example, the the product research, the I have a human resources, so different types of engagement engagements. So, should I focus on all these different types or...  Tell me, what are the different types of engagements? What are you about?  So I will just go through them really quick. So the first one, as I said, is the coaching. Second one, product research and brain.  Storming for marketing teams, creative planning, e-learning and education.  A internal auditing.  A inclusion, assistant for a Teams yes, these are all valid thing well it thinks  absolutely uh legitimate targets absolutely like agile meetings you are more about about what are the audience we want to tackle but yeah i am about how to process any of the all of this into a a result any of this right okay we\\'ll be iterating on on those we will be iterating okay so it brings a lot of value when you are also thinking about what you\\'re going to do not about like not what is the you know like you\\'re making a car but what is the what the what the what the what is the production line right because what you\\'re going to produce but about how you\\'re going to produce because this way we can produce whatever we can We can put whatever piece of text and then get the result of who is actually been posting about it lately.  The question is if you want to do these things like to outreach people in various social media and outreach and then later to communicate with them about this thing to yeah at least we we yeah it will start with outreach so uh first creating a bunch of requests And the result of running this code would be a report comprehending of report of you\\'ll be seeing what are actually what\\'s the channel what\\'s the person you can go and research the channel yourself to accommodate yourself about about it about this guy and then to outreach mm-hmm  Yeah, I think that in terms of the pipeline, it really depends on how the social media promotes this sort of content.\\n\\n## Meeting 7 - December 05, 2024 10:02\\n\\n- [11:10] This chunk occurs during a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and Oleg Ageychev, where Dmitry acknowledges Oleg\\'s expertise in content marketing and video production while discussing his own work in creating original and effective products related to communication and advertising.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  Я знаю, что ты специалист по контент-маркетингу, наверное, если я правильно выражаюсь.

Кстати, это тоже надо бы сделать, конечно, с учетом того, что ты делаешь.\\n- [15:04] The chunk occurs during a discussion between Oleg Ageychev and Dmitry Grankin about the importance of communication in the context of a developing product and its relevance to the sector, highlighting the need for effective communication strategies as the market evolves.\\n  > Oleg Ageychev:  Короче, коммуникации становятся важны для сектора, вот, как будто.\\n- [15:28] The chunk occurs during a discussion between Oleg Ageychev and Dmitry Grankin about the potential for creative communication strategies in their respective projects.

Dmitry explains the concept of product-led growth and how sharing call links can enhance user engagement and marketing efforts.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  Вот, это еще и на самом деле механизм product-led growth, есть такой термин, вот, когда я отправляю такое следствие, общение и я его отправлю со ссылкой прямо на на на этот звонок да и ты когда переходишь по ссылке ты получаешь профиль с этим звонком и хочешь продолжить Может, вот установи сообщение экстеншен и пользуйся.  Да, понятно. Это  понятно, почему это нужно тебе для маркетинга. И ссылка эта в любом случае придет. Я скорее, да, вот Вот про некое разграничение твоего продукта в отношениях твоего продукта с пользователем.\\n- [23:03] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and Oleg Ageychev, where Dmitry discusses his focus on product development and user feedback, expressing a reluctance to spend time on fundraising or external investments that do not directly contribute to delivering value to his clients.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  То есть, короче говоря, мне очень интересно на самом деле знать, сколько бы мне дали сейчас, но я Я не готов на это тратить нисколько времени, то есть у меня его нет, я не хочу тратить время на то, что относится не к тому, чтобы доставить продукт клиенту.\\n- [26:12] This chunk occurs during a conversation between Oleg Ageychev and Dmitry Grankin, where Oleg discusses the importance of effectively communicating the value of Dmitry\\'s product to different audiences. He reflects on his own business experiences and emphasizes the need to tailor messaging to resonate with both technical and creative individuals.\\n  > Oleg Ageychev:  Да, это надо формулировать, потому что тут Понятно, что там люди разные, что ты вот такой и так далее, но, по факту, вот эта ценность, она твоя и твоих клиентов вот дальше ее нужно подумать как ее транслировать так чтобы ну чтобы условно и ботаником это нравилось ты понятно что там до ботаников ты будешь сам твой чувак абсолютно такой технически и так далее чтобы это нравилось там и креативным персам и таким чтобы короче сама эта ценность была транслирована так как бы максимально широко вот Ценность, да, она именно в этом.  Именно в том, что я тоже...  Почему я занимался бизнесом так, как я им занимался?  Вот в таком бутиковом формате.  У меня был бизнес, когда у меня было много продюсеров.  и так далее.  Потом я это все уволил, всех остался один.  Почему?  Потому что мне нравилось делать то, что я делаю самому.\\n- [38:05] The chunk occurs at the end of a conversation between Oleg Ageychev and Dmitry Grankin, where they discuss the progress of Dmitry\\'s project, Vexia, and the need for competitor analysis. Oleg suggests concluding the discussion and mentions he will look into the competitors while agreeing to stay in touch.\\n  > :  хорошо дим на этом давай наверно закончим на сегодня ссылки на конкурентов ну из  Вексу я сейчас тоже буду крутить, и что-то с ней пока поваляется.  Окей, договорились. Давай.  Давай, на связи.  Пока.\\n\\n## Meeting 16 - December 13, 2024 11:30\\n\\n- [13:07] In this section of the conversation, Viktoria Kharlamova discusses the challenges related to product packaging and onboarding, emphasizing the need for a solid business model. She highlights the lack of user engagement and the importance of analyzing user registration and usage statistics to improve onboarding effectiveness, while also identifying traffic as a critical issue that has not been adequately addressed.\\n  > Viktoria Kharlamova:  То есть правильно я понимаю, что все-таки, ну то есть из проблем, которые, по крайней мере, я вижу, Вот эта история с тем, что буду доупаковать продукт и анбординг, чтобы подготовить его, чтобы была возможность продавать с точки зрения грамотной бизнес-модели.  Вот, или, ну, то есть мне хочется просто немножко понять больше из твоих ожиданий, с чем нужна помощь.  Да, да, да, вот я еще чуть закончу.  Вот этого товарища я...  слышал не видел не знаю кто он и он не хочет со мной общаться то есть как бы есть пользователи с которыми нет никакой как бы личной связи и никакие Никакого личного внимания, которое давно пользуется и регулярно, что есть, на мой взгляд, хороший сигнал.  Да, что я думаю, ну вот если взять новые, значит, регистрации, вот новые регистрации, Вчера было три новых регистрации, ни одного использования. Вот это для меня показатель того, что либо анбординг не пройден, либо у них не было еще встречи.  одно из двух вот дальше мы смотрим что было использование два раза использовали Здесь, наверное, надо вывести нормальную какую-то статистику из этого, для того, чтобы понять эффективность онбординга. Но, на мой взгляд, очевидно, что узкое место в трафике.  Потому что трафиком никто ни в каком серьезном виде не занимался вообще, это все какие-то непонятные люди без UTM-ок.  И тенем, кем мы трачим, но они все прямые.\\n- [15:01] The chunk is part of a conversation between Viktoria Kharlamova and Dmitry Grankin, where Viktoria discusses her focus on onboarding and monetization strategies for a product, while acknowledging that traffic generation is outside her expertise. She emphasizes the importance of identifying key problems and how she can assist in addressing them, particularly in relation to onboarding and monetization challenges.\\n  > Viktoria Kharlamova:  Тут смотри, наверное, сразу же скажу, что я фокусируюсь на анбординге и монетизации, то есть то, что касается трафика.  с этим я помочь точно не смогу.  Вот, то есть это не моя специальность.  Вот, моя история — это про анбординг и про монетизацию.  Вот, я поэтому...  Самое важное, на мой взгляд, что важно понять, это то, где ты видишь ключевую проблему и насколько я реально могу с этим помочь.  Вот. То есть насколько, я не знаю, насколько...  Сейчас я понимаю, что анбординг, он вообще для всех и всегда является проблемой, вот.  Но я тут скорее про то, что если ты видишь еще проблему в трафике, то тут опять же, если у вас кто-то, кто этим фокусно занимается, либо, ну, вы планируете  менять человека сушину узкое место очевидно в трафике но вы до онбординг монетизация монетизация давай давай с этой позиции продолжим дальнейший разговор тогда  Ну да, смотри, то есть...  Важно, да, безусловно.\\n- [19:11] The chunk is part of a conversation between Viktoria Kharlamova and Dmitry Grankin discussing the strategic approach to improving their product\\'s performance. Viktoria emphasizes the importance of integrating traffic generation into their system while also focusing on onboarding and monetization, suggesting that these elements should be developed concurrently to ensure user engagement and product utilization.\\n  > Viktoria Kharlamova:  То есть это не заработает все, конечно, без трафика, поэтому эта история все равно должна в систему быть обязательно включена.  Безусловно, да. Согласен.  Вот.  Понятно, что надо начинать, наверное, с трафика.  Ну окей, давай тогда продолжим.  Я бы так сказала, что здесь можно начинать с анбординга до прически его, потом...  Трафик и потом монетизация.  Ну, то есть трафик с монетизацией будут примерно в одно и то же время.  Вот так вот.  Потому что можно налить трафика, но если будет не очень анбординг, они так и не используют продукт.  Вот, и это нехорошо.  Вот, монетизация, но она вот скорее там после или в процессе анборсинга тоже потянется, как в принципе и трафик.  Ну, окей, то есть все одновременно надо делать, как обычно.\\n- [20:01] This chunk is part of a conversation between Viktoria Kharlamova and Dmitry Grankin, where Viktoria discusses her flexible consulting approach focused on onboarding and monetization strategies for Dmitry\\'s product. She emphasizes the importance of analyzing user flow and gathering user feedback to improve the product, while also addressing the need for traffic generation and the implementation of monetization strategies.\\n  > Viktoria Kharlamova:  Ну, я бы сказала, начинать точно с отбординга, вот, а остальное уже просто чуть попозже.  Окей.  Вот, по формату примерно так.  Как ты видишь построение этого процесса?  Слушай, тут на самом деле я супергибкая, то есть мой формат работы — это консультации.  Обычно это раз в неделю часовые консультации, которые, соответственно, команда...  Обычно не больше двух человек, ну, мне кажется, это как раз-таки тот формат, когда, не знаю, это можно назвать дизайнером, я думаю, что даже нужно 100%.  Вот, вы готовите свои вопросы, вот, я...  Отдельным пакетом услуг у меня идет анализ флоу, но мне кажется, что вам это не нужно, потому что, ну, типа, флоу не такое большое, и, скорее всего, это можно будет разобрать просто на консультации и вырассказать.  скажите, какие исследования вы проводили, что делали и так далее.  Вот, и мы с вами это все проанализируем и посмотрим, и вы начнете улучшать определенные вещи, исходя из моего фидбэка, плюс исходя из правильных исследований.  Вот, то же самое касается монетизации, ну, то есть это вы приходите с какими-то своими гипотезами, потому что вы, в принципе, понимаете, что у вас за пользователи и потенциально каким...  Есть какая-то информация о том, каким образом они могут вам платить, вот, и мы с вами это тоже обсуждаем, вот, и, соответственно, потом вы это имплементите поэтапно, сначала, я говорю, онбординг, на мой взгляд, это первая история, потом...  включается трафик и там после трафика либо во время монетизация я думаю что на самом деле монетизацию не стоит сильно откладывать потому что ну логично без  вопрос просто как ее реализовать технически нет никаких проблем хотя бы фейк-пэймент какой-то будет иметь, понимаешь?  Ага.  Да, да, да.\\n- [25:24] The chunk is part of a conversation between Viktoria Kharlamova and Dmitry Grankin discussing the future of a product, including aspects of traffic generation, monetization, and user experience with tools used for meetings. It reflects on the importance of user awareness regarding recording tools and the advantages of their product\\'s features.\\n  > Viktoria Kharlamova:  Когда, не знаю, будет трафик, вы протестите, и будет другая стадия, может быть, внедрите самостоятельную монетизацию и захотите скейлиться, тогда уже будет смысл вместе поработать.  Да.  Окей. Да, я думаю, так, наверное, и будет.  Супер. Тогда здорово, что написал.  Классно, что вы движетесь в интересном направлении.  У тебя такие зонты.  какие в мете проходят в зуме или как слушай либо в мете либо в зуме ну то  есть 50 на 50 примерно используешь какие-то такие инструменты я использовала tldr по-моему назывался вот мне не очень нравится я вообще поняла что они мне не очень нужны я делаю самозметки вот плюс мне не очень нравится отсутствие но короче не все инструменты следует правилам секьюрности ну то есть я считаю что когда ты что-то записываешь  важно чтобы человек об этом знал что тебя смешает сообщить об этом  Ну, я думаю, что это должно быть проактивно со стороны инструмента, скорее, вот так вот происходить.  Все так или иначе каким-то образом сообщают, но, например, да.  например это делаю через чат но никто не видит в основном нам как раз бот приходит прямо на звонок сидит на звонке он прекрасно видно.  Ну да, да, да, да, часто вот формат такой, он в принципе окей.  Это людей, кому как, как выяснилось от обратной связи от пользователей, главное преимущество.  моего продукта это то что бот не висит на звонке не то что люди знают или не знают о том что он записывает о том что вот такая вот 3 3 человек сейчас третьим  аватар вот и 2 мульти язычность то что можно в любой момент приключиться на любой другой язык  Угу. Да, да, да, да, это точно.  Good. Тогда рада была поболтать. Вот, надеюсь, что...\\n- [27:39] The chunk is part of a conversation between Viktoria Kharlamova and Dmitry Grankin, discussing the development and monetization strategies for a product. It concludes with Viktoria expressing hope for successful implementation and offering future assistance.\\n  > :  получится заимплементировать классную монетизацию, сделать первые результаты,  начать растить продукты, потом, если понадобится помощь, обязательно пиши.  Давай, спасибо тебе большое.  Давай, хорошего дня.\\n\\n## Meeting 15 - December 12, 2024 16:00\\n\\n- [03:03] This chunk occurs during a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and the AI Marketing Directory team, where Dmitry inquires about the structure of their meeting and expresses interest in conducting a customer development interview to discuss product pivoting and gather insights about his product, Vexa.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  Do you feel like customer development to review is the right format for us?  today from your side obviously okay i\\'m sorry can you yeah how do you want to have our meeting today structured?

Dmitry shares his personal experience with summarizing calls for his older partner, highlighting the limited use he finds for the tool, which is primarily for recalling general ideas from meetings.\\n  > AI Marketing Directory:  literally only one specific i started doing it for one reason because our third partner um is an older guy and he uh he you know sometimes when i like talk to him about calls that i have a little summary so I literally you know if he asked me I\\'ll pull it up but but that\\'s pretty much the only use I found for it so far you\\'ve been reporting with was this  so you\\'ve been creating reports about your communities with with the other partner  no no so like i summarize my i don\\'t use it for like you know sometimes You know, like I, I do it for, you know, I summarize like a call that I had, I\\'ll put it, you know, in like a Google drive document and like, you know, if, if my, if the other partner asks us about it, I\\'ll pull it up on my phone.

And we can do other cool things too, like list the products mentioned.\\n- [13:05] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and the AI Marketing Directory team, where Dmitry discusses the features and functionalities of Vexa, a meeting note-taking tool that utilizes GPT for real-time context and post-meeting summaries. The dialogue highlights the tool\\'s ability to filter and research past meetings, emphasizing its innovative approach to managing meeting information.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  and we have what\\'s the product say it again that\\'s good that\\'s cool fireflies the children vexa and we have a list with description so basically you got this GPT real-time with you or the meeting which has got all the real-time context ready to go and okay and that is during the meeting and after meeting we\\'ll get this thing which is Dashboard Here is our meeting with God which is not finished yet it does not indexed yet because we tend to, yeah, index meetings after being made, you\\'ve got, uh short summary you\\'ve got this uh points of interest and most interestingly yeah you can filter uh by because you spoke lately, and you can continue research in even a global fashion like this, what is...  And that will be working over all the meetings that\\'s been collected during the the last few months which is quite uh yeah quite a number 763 that\\'s um no that\\'s that\\'s super cool i  Have not seen a tool like that where you can like take all of the context from all of your meetings and then interact with it so  Yeah, yeah like that. Yeah, and then you can research specific people like this like you chat about this person who is Lara and here we have got the context of meetings that i had with this specific person only and you can share me meetings with this and uh so it\\'s taking your like your conversations with that  woman lara and summarizing it that\\'s what it\\'s doing yeah actually  I\\'ve asked about who is Lara. And it\\'s very cool. Yeah, these three conversations here and here is the output. And It works in a different way for global chat and with the meeting-specific chat, there are different context memories.\\n- [16:07] This chunk occurs during a discussion between Dmitry Grankin and representatives from AI Marketing Directory, where Dmitry presents the features and benefits of his product, Vexa, a meeting note-taking tool.

Well, very cool things and, the product manager but basically now i can i i develop faster because i\\'m a developer and i have we have basically the market tools that deliver the ai augmentation of coding that gives you like a boost that you wouldn\\'t be able to find before and you don\\'t basically you basically don\\'t need anyone to move really fast now yeah  We, we, we, uh, we\\'re on the same wavelength as that. I mean, you know, right now it\\'s just me and Phil and we\\'re, um, I mean, we have content writers and other people that work for us part-time, I guess.  But, um, yeah, so.  we understand, but thank you for the presentation for sure.\\n- [19:14] This chunk occurs towards the end of a conversation between representatives of AI Marketing Directory and Dmitry Grankin, the founder of Vexa. It focuses on discussing the next steps for collaboration, specifically regarding the crafting of a new landing page and how the AI Marketing Directory can support Vexa in growing its personal brand and content strategy.\\n  > AI Marketing Directory:  So I guess maybe the next step for us might be, you know, like i said we\\'re crafting a new landing page but we could send you we pretty much have it all we know what we\\'re what it\\'s going what\\'s going to be on it and everything so we could send you an email um you know with you know, all the, all the information, and we can maybe, you know, you can let us know how you feel about that, and I guess, you know, in light of your situation, you know, we\\'ll, we\\'ll, you know, we\\'ll see, um, like, but, um, like, what we can deal with with respect to that um so does that sound good to you yeah sure um all right and then yeah sorry we\\'re gonna say no i was gonna say yeah we could just send over an email with what our offer is and kind of how we think it would work well for BEXA and you personally, especially if you\\'re trying to grow your personal brand along with BEXA.  Because obviously, that\\'s going to help.  So yeah, we\\'ll send over all the details, and then.  MARIUSZ GASIEWSKI, But can you share with me the idea?\\n- [22:22] This chunk is part of a conversation between the AI Marketing Directory and Dmitry Grankin, discussing the structure and frequency of their potential partnership, specifically focusing on content planning and collaboration for VEXA, a meeting note-taking tool.\\n  > AI Marketing Directory:  Yeah, we\\'ll detail out what the partnership would even look like, cause we would wanna meet with you like every two weeks, get an idea of what\\'s going on with VEXA and he, product updates, any thing that you want to push to these audiences that we\\'re building up for you. Any like industry news that you want to touch on like those kind of things. And then, like come up with a content plan based on our conversations for like the next two weeks and then we just kind of do it all over again yeah I feel like as of May\\n- [24:05] This chunk occurs during a discussion between Dmitry Grankin and the AI Marketing Directory team about the challenges of content creation for Vexa, specifically addressing the need for visual materials in blog posts and the importance of balancing personal vision with outsourcing tasks for effective content implementation.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  But actually, like if you want to If you want to write a blog post, you usually need to supply it with visual materials and here comes the uh hand your hand like a lot of work uh this thing which is uh better get outsourced and so like staying somewhere in the middle but be between actually coaching and content plan and work pushing it through your own vision and then then delegating the downstream for actually for actual implementation would probably work best.  Awesome.  Staying in the loop of creating this content like us in the chain.  not to stay outside because staying outside I am pretty sure I know that I had this it would bring you something And that you 100% will not, yeah, it\\'s not your product, not your content.  Right, yeah, and we would...\\n- [25:19] This chunk is part of a conversation between representatives of AI Marketing Directory and Dmitry Grankin, discussing their new approach to content creation for founder-led companies. It highlights their expertise in crafting viral content and leveraging an influencer network, emphasizing the importance of both content creation and distribution strategies in their marketing efforts.\\n  > AI Marketing Directory:  And we could just, we just have the knowledge and skill set to put that together in a way that has like viral potential yeah and two things i want to say uh echoing phil\\'s point yeah like one that\\'s like the common problem we\\'re finding is like you know all these founders they have great ideas obviously for other starting companies.  But like Phil said, like, you know, we have the knowledge and expertise to not only put it together in a way that\\'s well, but quickly.  And the second thing is like, you know, we\\'re also gonna be utilizing our, influencer network that we\\'ve been aggregating.  Part of the reason we\\'re targeting Twitter first and not LinkedIn right now is not just because we have probably more knowledge of Twitter, but we\\'ve been aggregating a huge influencer network for a long time.  know, um, you know, and we we pay for that exposure out of our pockets. So we take care of that, you know, so there are elements of distribution and elements of creation involved in it. So, you know, it\\'s it\\'s not\\n- [26:04] This chunk occurs towards the end of a conversation between representatives of AI Marketing Directory and Dmitry Grankin, the founder of Vexa, where they discuss the next steps for collaboration, including sending an email summarizing their discussion and outlining their content creation and marketing strategy.\\n  > :  just the content but that\\'s obviously a huge portion of it yeah got it okay guys  thanks for your time dan  great so yeah so we\\'ll send you i\\'ll send you an email like today or tomorrow and we\\'ll i\\'ll  summarize it for you that sounds good yeah sure thanks a lot all right well thanks for your time  dimitri thank you  Nej.\\n\\n## Meeting 3 - December 03, 2024 11:05\\n\\n- [10:06] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitriy Grankin and Daniel discussing the competitive landscape of AI transcription tools, specifically focusing on the limitations of competitors like Fireflies and TLDV, and highlighting the advantages of Dmitriy\\'s solution, which offers more flexibility and privacy for users.\\n  > Dmitriy Grankin:  That looks like a deliberate decision they made in order to...  abstract themselves from the general market and dig deeper into the corporate sphere okay that\\'s their choice it it\\'s it\\'s been beneficial for us yeah and and it\\'s a choice that doesn\\'t i i don\\'t see okay they  could like have some extra features when you have the google workspace but they are just liberally not leaving you to use it if you are not a google workspace user which is they are removing this market from uh which yeah of course they are like focusing on specific customers and that\\'s fine.  But I think today there are many options from Google Workspace.  Like you have other providers more like less centralized as Google, as Microsoft.  And some people like, I don\\'t like the idea of being stuck to any provider.  So I don\\'t like that.  like the idea and your solution seems more like free. You install your Google Chrome adapter there and you can use it if you don\\'t like it you uninstall it and your data is not being shared with like google or anything anything besides the thing that you chose to use So I like this approach of being less dependent on other existing ecosystems to work.  Yeah, and I-  Depends on Chrome, let\\'s say.  If I use Safari, for example, I wouldn\\'t, which is one limitation, but I think it\\'s just a strategic moment that you are using.  using Chrome as a first implementation.  And if it works probably later, you will create plugins for other browsers.  It\\'s just that.  Yeah, yeah.\\n\\n## Meeting 1 - November 26, 2024 15:01\\n\\n- [01:04] The chunk is part of a conversation between Alisa Molokova and Dmitry Grankin, where Alisa introduces herself and her professional background, highlighting her experience in sales and focus on international markets, particularly the USA and Europe, as they discuss potential collaboration on outreach strategies for Dmitry\\'s project.\\n  > Alisa Molokova:  тогда если рассказать о себе еще с того что я не писала не говорила да то я более 5 лет опять же работаю в таком подходе сама так сказать Выходец IT-компании, то есть начинал с нуля, доросла до руководителя отдела продаж.  Мой фокус это как раз-таки зарубежные рынки, чаще всего это США, Европа фокус.  Также был опыт работы и смены, и слотам.  Ну и в целом сейчас такая есть тенденция, тоже российские бизнесы стали выходить и пользоваться активно такими инструментами.\\n- [10:38] This chunk is part of a conversation between Alisa Molokova and Dmitry Grankin, where they discuss lead generation, the importance of meetings in B2B contexts, and the planning of marketing strategies over the next few months. Alisa emphasizes the need for client involvement in meetings and the challenges of making long-term plans in a dynamic environment.\\n  > Alisa Molokova:  Ну, да, тут такая штука, если там лиды заявки я могу обеспечить, то проведение уже как раз-таки встреч, да, там для каких-то нюансов, это как раз-таки...  уже на стороне клиента, всегда заказчика.  Вот тем более, если мы говорим про B2B-компании, там все равно как бы контракты уже другие, все равно комплексные решения и встречи.  Встречи, они, я думаю, что необходимы, не так, чтобы просто поднимать руку.  Да, ну, в принципе, это одна из каких-то ближайших все равно вещей, которые по маркетингу.  я хотел бы делать а если вот одна из ближайших то на какой срок примерно ориентируешься ну то есть скажем три месяца полгода  полгода вот через какое через какое время начать такими горизонтами вообще  Ага.  Вот. Но на этой неделе, наверное, нет.  Вот так бы я сказал.  Это хорошо.  Хорошо, это понятно. Ну, то есть, скажем, не знаю...  В то же время и сказать тоже наперед невозможно, потому что очень динамично происходит.  Импульс-реакция. Поэтому в таких условиях трудно что-то планировать сильно наперёд.\\n- [14:16] This chunk is part of a conversation between Alisa Molokova and Dmitry Grankin, where they discuss strategies for outreach and communication, specifically focusing on using email and LinkedIn for reaching their target audience. Alisa emphasizes the importance of writing to both channels and requests Dmitry to formulate a concise commercial proposal, while also mentioning potential opportunities in Web3 development and engagement with audiences in Brazil.\\n  > Alisa Molokova:  email то есть той же частью аудитории мы пишем сразу же на два источника канала потому что существует такая история что есть всегда группа людей которые в линке несмотря на то что это проще это социальная сеть социальная сеть они не отвечают и реагируют гораздо быстрее на почте за счет своих должностных обязанностей на почту мы всегда пишем на рабочий домен вот не на личный а Я просто сейчас  я себе тут сайт уронил, я тут переезжаю с сайта, уронил его.  Поэтому я немножко отвлекся. Ты мне предложение сформулируй, пожалуйста, в 250 символов.  И тогда разбежимся пока что.  По переписке ты имеешь в виду в Телеграм?  Нет, ну Телеграм, кстати, Телеграм тоже может быть, может быть.  Может быть. Так, давай сейчас сосредоточимся. Что ты про Телеграмм сказала?  Ты сказала о том, чтобы сформулировать тебе...  ...сообщение в 250 символов, поэтому я спрашиваю, что ты имеешь под этим?  В Telegram написать конкретное коммерческое предложение вообще?  Ну, да, коммерческое предложение, да, предложение какое-то, да, сформулировать. Вот.  Вот. Есть такое...  Такое ощущение, что надо идти в команды, которые занимаются Web3-разработкой, и у нас есть хороший отклик из большинства.  Из Бразилии. И может быть, и то, и то, может быть на одно, на это и на то.  сориентироваться. Бразилия и ВОП-3.  Ну, это очень важные тоже нюансы, которые...  которые мы потом будем обсуждать.  А так, в общем, сформулирую, пожалуйста, предложение.  Вот. Окей?

So I don\\'t know if you\\'ve worked, you haven\\'t worked with Marcus before, have you?  Not particularly, I\\'ve had a, I\\'ve been on a couple of emails with him, but yeah, no.  Actually, Samantha is here.  Oh, she\\'s here.  No, sorry, computer\\'s not working, so I\\'m on my phone.  No problem.  That\\'s fine.  You won\\'t see my pretty pictures, but that\\'s all right.  Oh, I should, I should be.  oh you can see okay okay yeah yeah um yeah so i was just saying that i\\'ve uh just sort of introducing myself so um i just started with vero not too Long ago, my background is in everything marketing, B2B, B2C, lots of acquisition and product marketing, direct response, marketing operations, and brand management and campaign management and all of the things that go with that and being probably burned out by all the things I\\'ve had to do throughout.\\n- [05:10] This chunk is part of a discussion between Shannon Clegg and Dianna Lloyd regarding the development of an email sequence aimed at guiding leads through their purchase journey for ToraShop. It highlights the importance of raising awareness about ToraShop\\'s offerings and the need for collaboration on recommendations related to HubSpot to optimize the email workflow.\\n  > Shannon Clegg:  purchase journey starting with awareness because obviously you know they\\'re now a lead within the system but they might not be aware of tourist shop even though they\\'re very aware of tourism marketing and incentivizing them and showing them the USPs around what ToraShop could do for them as a business.  So that\\'s where we landed with this sequence.  and we\\'re really hoping to obviously get it up and running as quickly as possible.  And I understand you have some questions or perhaps some recommendations based on HubSpot.  So we would love to go through those now and kind of lock everything in so that we can go live and start to understand the learnings around what\\'s working and what we could be doing better yeah that\\'s perfect um so i did uh  One of the things that\\'s good about this process when you\\'re actually building the emails is it\\'s just like anything.  When you get in, you start seeing things  where things look great on paper,  you start going through the workflow and you go, Oh, wait a minute, you know, we\\'ve already said this here.  And you know what I mean?\\n- [15:02] This chunk occurs during a discussion about optimizing a contact form in HubSpot, specifically addressing the inclusion of email domains and website URLs, as well as potential data validation features to enhance lead capture and management processes.\\n  > Dianna Lloyd:  Is there, like we can say no Gmail addresses, things like that.  you know how it\\'s been set up but um I can have a look at that and get back to you if I have any suggestions on the form other than that it\\'s okay if some of them I know most  spams our Gmail or something like that.  But we did recently get a client who still uses a Gmail account.  So I wouldn\\'t completely abort it.  I know it\\'s quite a rare case, but he does.  And you might actually, now that I\\'m thinking about it, you might get URLs.  People don\\'t have a URL because it\\'s personal branding.  Is that possible?  That\\'s possible.  Sometimes, yeah, that\\'s possible.  And then the other thing is they don\\'t have a URL because they\\'re trying to build a new website or they\\'re trying to launch.  i mean it\\'s still maybe we just have it um it\\'s there now so if they if they enter that\\'s great  it just we can\\'t make it if you\\'re gonna have clients that don\\'t if it\\'s not completely b2b actually make it that yeah yeah okay so going back to this um sorry sorry just an afterthought  we could make it We could make it compulsory and if they don\\'t have a website, I don\\'t know if we can put an put in if you don\\'t have a website, put in your LinkedIn profile.  You know, I don\\'t think that can be done, but I\\'ll have a look.  I look, I\\'ve built quite a number of forms on HubSpot and I\\'ve never been able to see anything that\\'s not.  Yeah, that\\'s fine.  There\\'s some new stuff though with their forms.  There is some conditional data validation.  So let me have a look, okay?  Okay.  that\\'s a good idea it was just an afterthought data validation and i don\\'t know enough about it  You know more than I do, that\\'s for sure.\\n- [23:18] This chunk occurs during a discussion among team members about the messaging and branding for their marketing efforts, specifically regarding the Taurus shop. They express concerns about maintaining brand clarity and the potential confusion caused by mixed messaging. The conversation emphasizes the need to review automated messages and forms to ensure they align with the intended brand perception.\\n  > keep:  that means this is not probably not the right um messaging we want out there i sorry shop is there but it\\'s um we got to be careful not to mix up our brand and and get the wrong perception out there which is Which is, Diana, what we can do as an action item after all these is review all these forms.  Yeah.  Because I haven\\'t seen these forms and the wordings in there.  Okay.  So the forms, so if I go book a discovery call from the shop page, it takes me to the contact us page.  Sorry, what I mean by form.  is those automated messages you\\'re showing us that have the right\\n\\n## Meeting 4 - December 03, 2024 14:31\\n\\n- [23:45] The chunk is part of a conversation between Aleksandr Lavrinenko and Dmitry Grankin discussing their respective products and potential collaborations. In this specific segment, Aleksandr expresses his intention to suggest to his co-founder the idea of testing a product called VEX, considering the possibility of integrating it with Chrome for cost-effectiveness, while reflecting on the competitive landscape.\\n  > :  Короче, знаешь, я после нашего разговора точно предложу кофаундеру VEX попробовать, чтобы протестить, может быть, базово, и подумаю над тем, чтобы...  хрома подрубиться может быть это будет дешевле я к меню почитаю как тактика это делает ну да ну просто  Просто взяли все готовенькое и продают это пользователям.  Молодцы.\\n\\n## Meeting 10 - December 05, 2024 19:00\\n\\n- [04:54] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and Lara Vargas discussing recent updates and features of the Yexa platform, emphasizing its new dashboard capabilities and the importance of collecting insights from meetings to build knowledge.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  sometimes in the future we\\'ll do that because because because why not actually yeah okay um so we we\\'ve done something We\\'ve done some significant refurbishment of Yexa recently and Now it\\'s not only the real-time and as a real-time assistant but also it\\'s nice it\\'s a nice dashboard and the idea behind that is that you share a lot of valuable insights during these meetings and people tend to share it with you openly because like people people people say things that they tend not to to write each other right and the idea is to collect this and build knowledge with it so each meeting becomes a unit of knowledge with Wow with actions with with knowledge points, discussion points, people mentioned companies with descriptions and chat like that, which enables you to research specific meetings like it\\'s pretty weird why is that in Russian by the way this because we spoke english i believe  but maybe you i don\\'t know i don\\'t know if you and alia were in the call before Okay, maybe, yeah, we got you.\\n- [06:05] This chunk occurs during a discussion between Dmitry Grankin and Lara Vargas about the functionalities and features of VEXA, including its research capabilities and the organization of follow-up calls and content calendars.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  just a little bit of conversation in russian maybe that was what that\\'s the reason and that the previous conversation like action points from that table so just to record recall what we\\'ve been up for the follow-up call content calendar yeah so that\\'s how it works and we also have A global chart, which works like what is VEXA.  Oh, okay.  research people, they do some general kind of research, competitors.  Okay, that\\'s really nice.\\n- [06:48] This chunk occurs during a discussion between Dmitry Grankin and Lara Vargas about recent updates and improvements to the VEXA platform, specifically focusing on the introduction of a new dashboard feature that enhances user experience and engagement after meetings.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  Yeah, so people have been asking for a dashboard because real-time capabilities are nice have but but after meeting is something that they tend to use a lot so this attempt to deliver something  Yeah, I think it\\'s great. And also from a product perspective, it also increases the time that people spend with Vaxxer.  I think it\\'s a really good way forward for the product.  And to me, it\\'s one of the coolest things about VEXA, is this capability.  of resuming and getting the actual point and all of this.  So this is really nice.\\n- [08:19] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and Lara Vargas discussing the performance and user retention of their product, VEXA, particularly highlighting its appeal to Brazilian users due to its multilingual capabilities.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  Yeah, and it becomes, I don\\'t know, it becomes a market actually we\\'ve got we\\'ve got competitors uh we\\'ve our products got retention with users and steady influx of new users daily and actually quite a lot of from Brazil I don\\'t have a good analytic system to understand what is actually the source but these links don\\'t happen UTMs. But as a matter of fact, there\\'s a lot of Brazilians, maybe because of the multilingual capabilities of VEXA.  what people like about it is that it seriously switches from one language to\\n- [10:17] This chunk occurs during a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and Lara Vargas, where they discuss the impact of an influencer\\'s promotion on user engagement with VEXA, specifically referencing a community of alumni in Brazil and the productivity initiatives led by a notable figure in that community.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  i can see a significant spike these days um okay uh like I don\\'t know, maybe it\\'s got a prolonged effect, but I can\\'t see any segmentation.  significant spikes at this on these dates yeah um i think that this is something that she  will be releasing for like it\\'s it\\'s a perk of her community so it\\'s like it will be in a dashboard as well and they can like choose from from different perks and vexa is among you know okay uh can you share  with the link where where this it\\'s uh it\\'s a closed community okay of uh and  like alumni. Do you know like alumni? It\\'s something like this, so it\\'s previous students of her that are in this community also.  students in brazil yeah in brazil and this is a this is the person in brazil that is one of the most known persons in productivity actually this woman Ela é a pessoa que está empurrando o projeto da semana de trabalho de quatro dias no Brasil.  Ok, ok.\\n- [12:40] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and Lara Vargas discussing the potential for influencer partnerships to promote their product, VEXA. They analyze the impact of a YouTube video by an influencer named Lucas, the effectiveness of social media marketing, and the challenges Dmitry faces with his Instagram account. The dialogue reflects their strategies for user acquisition and engagement, particularly focusing on Brazilian users and the importance of content visibility over time.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  Um, so I, I feel like it\\'s got a lot of potential, even though we don\\'t have, uh, you know, payment implemented for now but still free users is something that still proves availability of the all the tone and let me and i i see a lot of people from this crypto web 3 world using the tool nice from from brazil nice okay so they they show good retention that\\'s a good sign yes let\\'s let\\'s see what we can do how can we move forward with this okay  would you like to to make new influencers partnerships yeah we can  make new we can we can make another ...with Louis as well.  Another, okay.  Yeah, because I feel like his publication was sometimes in September.  Can we check what was the date he actually published his YouTube video?  let me see that lucas published the video yes yes it was the 26th of september 26th of september okay so  Peace.  okay 26th of september yeah it looks like uh there was something 26 yeah we had eight new registration and nine and uh and then uh it\\'s still like  And then from then it\\'s...  And from that time we had a lot of Brazilian registrations.  That\\'s great. Yeah, because I actually noticed the other day that this is something that Lucas commented with me at the time when he suggested said let\\'s do a youtube video because he said the youtube will be um it\\'s almost like an encyclopedia because the story the reels they go away after a while but the youtube when someone is looking for something they will reach it and i noticed that the video he posted with vexa has is still getting views after lots of time yes yes  it\\'s not that long it will yeah it will have prolonged effect yes exactly it can it can work for years and since there is actually he he made video with the previous version of the extension yeah previous version of the dashboard and he basically didn\\'t even touch the dashboard as as it was so it might he delivered the new Yes, and even if he would mention Vexile with every of his videos, it still would work.  because what work is that people hear about thing multiple times yeah is that uh once they just didn\\'t notice another time they noticed but they don\\'t have a problem next time they have a problem and they have some they just remember some And the other time they are actively looking for this thing that they heard about that I know by myself. It\\'s very typical behavior, usual behavior.  Yeah. Yeah. That\\'s true. Yeah. I think that from what you were saying, it would be nice to do another influencer round.  do you think that it worked what do you think yes i think we could do both like i think that because i\\'m seeing here that the the instagram of And it would be nice to have more photos that, so I have it open on my phone now.  I don\\'t know if I can share the screen.  But, for example, if we get more photos that are more corporate, you know, they can get more, add trust to the company as well.  You know, when people go into VEX after going from the, from the influencer or from Seeing some, if we do ads first, for example, we can also promote the video that Lucas posted.  I don\\'t know if you consider that we can, the video that Lucas posted, we can, you can make a paid promo with it on youtube or even on instagram like as a real  yeah i have a stupid problem with instagram I was I think I was blocked for life Instagram really what happened I just made a pretty stupid attempt to to scrape Instagram with my own you know headers I can I can help you did something how happen in the vexa  Instagram not vexa I\\'m about my own  which is okay which is uh you don\\'t like instagram i would like i just don\\'t have access to instagram for now i used to use it and i uh i just played around with instagram data scraping this data once uh uh about a couple of years ago so they just blocked me uh with my facebook no way so but we can make a  i can manage that if you want i can it\\'s pretty easy to set up uh um another account that\\'s an ads account yeah through facebook I can set it up and if you send me your Facebook link, do you still have a Facebook or no?  Yes, I do.  Oh, okay.  Yeah, Facebook works.\\n- [21:02] This chunk is part of a conversation between Lara Vargas and Dmitry Grankin, where Lara discusses her previous role as a marketing manager at Buitrix, detailing her responsibilities in user acquisition, CRM management, paid campaigns, and content creation for an energy monitoring product. The discussion highlights her experience in marketing strategy and the need for customer education regarding their innovative product.\\n  > Lara Vargas:  so uh in buitrix i was marketing manager so i handled basically everything user acquisition I created the marketing funnel for us.  I was in charge of our CRM that I was doing paid campaigns.  I was doing content creation, business strategy.  yeah content creation sorry what was the look like this contact creation i can show you  uh our instagram so i did a lot of branded content for them as well because, for example, our customer needed a lot to be educated in our product.  Right, because it\\'s an energy monitoring product.  So it\\'s something pretty innovative.\\n- [22:29] This chunk is part of a conversation between Lara Vargas and Dmitry Grankin, where Lara discusses her previous role as a marketing manager at Biltrix, focusing on content strategy, branded content, and social media engagement, particularly on LinkedIn. The discussion highlights her approach to educating customers and promoting the product, as well as her responsibilities in the marketing department.\\n  > Lara Vargas:  It\\'s for energy managers to have a platform to monitor their energy without needing to go to each location so it\\'s also to do with the productivity so uh it was very a very innovative product so one thing that we did a lot was a branded content so for example my content strategy i used to have a few content buckets that i called so i had the strategy for branded content which i They educated the customers on what was the product, how to get the energy in the best way, why getting the energy in that way was the best.  And then some were more completely promotional. So get our product for this amount of time. Why this is perfect.  and highlighting the value.  So we had some different kinds of buckets.  And then for example, one thing, our main social media was LinkedIn.  One content bucket that we see is very popular on LinkedIn is the team.  It gets a lot of traction and it actually for the product is something that at first first glance we think oh that\\'s not really helpful for the product but it helps a lot with the engagement rates of the company so it enhances the company\\'s the the company\\'s page presence which therefore for enhances the how the product uh posts will be available for the rest of the people so this is some of the stuff that i did at build tricks yeah tricks  mm-hmm how can I see more about what you\\'ve done there at the content Do you have a LinkedIn profile? Is it something that I should explore?  Yeah, I can send you the LinkedIn of Biltrix.  I was the only one in charge of the marketing.  Sometimes I had to focus on different things.\\n- [24:49] This chunk is part of a conversation between Lara Vargas and Dmitry Grankin, where Lara discusses her recent work on a Black Friday marketing campaign at Buildtrix, her preference for B2C over B2B marketing, and her desire to return to a more customer-focused role. She reflects on the differences in content creation between her previous job and her experience with Vexa, emphasizing the fulfillment she finds in understanding and engaging with customers directly.\\n  > Lara Vargas:  So for the last, for example, the month of October and November, I couldn\\'t focus much on content posting because we were focusing on creating our black friday campaign so i was doing a marketing funnel to create this black friday campaign so i spent the last last two months doing that yeah i will send you the page for build tricks and why are you living in the company Because I want to work more. I don\\'t really like working B2B, I have to say. I prefer working B2C. It makes me happier. It makes me...  I prefer talking to the customer, I think that I have a knack for understanding the customer, you know, I feel that I know what people want.  and i like talking to them about it i like feel i like the pleasure it gets me when i understand them uh means like you\\'re more like  on a product manager management site like talking to customers and customer development interviews all this all this stuff  Sim, eu quero dizer, quando eu estava, por exemplo, quando no Beatrix o conteúdo é muito mais impessoal, sabe, é muito mais...  Mesmo o copywriting, o que eu tenho que dizer ao cliente é muito mais impessoal.  O valor, o benefício que eu tenho que oferecer.  is more impersonal. It\\'s not how that person will improve its life, it\\'s how the company will improve their life. And for example, when I was working with you guys in Vexa, that was something way more fulfilling for me and that\\'s what what showed me that i actually wanted to go more uh go back into b2c so i\\'m yeah i\\'m actually looking for stuff in more related to b2c and you perceive the access to b2c product i think you guys have both right i think that there is uh the free use part there is the the paid part for the consumer but there is also the big the big part net right which is where you get most i think of the it\\'s where the the the mark the big value of the company will be right is selling to big companies but yeah i think that i believe that as as a startup fax will first grow in the consumer right and\\n- [27:20] The chunk occurs during a discussion between Dmitry Grankin and Lara Vargas about strategies for expanding VEXA\\'s user base and product offerings. Dmitry suggests exploring a top-down approach to penetrate companies, complementing their current bottom-up strategy that targets individual users.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  I would want to try out a top-down approach as well.\\n- [29:12] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and Lara Vargas discussing strategies for VEXA\\'s market penetration, focusing on both bottom-up and top-down approaches to reach companies through individual users. They explore the challenges related to security and privacy, potential solutions for deploying VEXA within company infrastructures, and the importance of new integrations to enhance the product\\'s value.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  Currently, the idea is that we are kind of implementing is that we approach individuals improving their day-to-day work working setup but sure enough this most likely this individuals are part of a company employees yeah and so the idea is that we could potentially if penetrate these companies through these individuals bottom up yeah and uh but actually this top-down approach could potentially work as well because there is something that blocks this bottom-up approach because of uh the security and privacy issues yeah from power and privacy policies they have and these things have to be addressed top down top down yes and we have an idea of a solution for that is that currently works is works uh server service in multiple clients and you have to trust vexa to uh to secure the data If you don\\'t want to do this, the idea is that you can deploy your own VEX backend inside your company infrastructure.  That\\'s a great idea.  Yeah, and that\\'s the way for those who want to to use this kind of service, but cannot.  Yeah, that sounds great.  And there\\'s a lot of users who basically They use VXR silently and they have no power to introduce VXR in silence.  that these companies because of these problems decisions  yeah i think that um do you also think in terms of new integrations Porque eu estava falando com algumas pessoas, por exemplo, eu conheço algumas pessoas no Venture Capital Building, mas no British Telecom, e eles said the product is amazing but they also have this barrier and even if they didn\\'t they use for example they use teams so considering that is that in your you  Yeah, new integration is something that is kind of an obvious way to go to expand, but even in this google meet environment there is still a lot of opportunities for now and in order You have limited resources where you want to go, whether you want to go and expand horizontally with new integrations or vertically to get...  more into the value the product delivers to the end customer.\\n- [31:49] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and Lara Vargas discussing strategies for content creation and marketing for their product, VEXA. Dmitry emphasizes the importance of understanding user needs and search engine optimization, suggesting a focus on creating content that addresses specific problems users face, such as acquiring transcripts from YouTube. The dialogue reflects their collaborative approach to enhancing product visibility and user engagement.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  And I chose, for now, I chose the second approach because there is actually a lot of companies teams uh that are into google meet hundred percent and um these are smaller teams smaller companies uh more modern ones and a lot of this web3 and all this web3 Maniacs, they are all into Google Meet 100%.  So I don\\'t say I don\\'t want to work with large corporations who are entirely on Microsoft Teams I want, but I just don\\'t have enough resources to tackle the both  directions for now yeah okay all right so okay so in terms of uh the content that we will be creating So, should we go forward? You want Instagram, new Instagram posts?  I think the right approach would be to forget what the actual product is and start from search engine optimization start from what people actually are looking for around the problem area we\\'re in and deliverance content and maybe even micro products.  for that specific problems like the example is that I recently researched tactic tactic is yeah yeah it\\'s a competitor The thing they were doing is that they probably noticed that there is such a problem as people searching on how to acquire transcripts from YouTube yeah and saw that as well which is a pretty straightforward thing yeah you can get it from API easily like it\\'s the latest it\\'s like this it\\'s it\\'s a very common request so basically what you do is you create a a page where and you will just drop drag and drop this your youtube link and get a transcript and you create a little bit of contact on youtube hey guys come in and we will give you this that\\'s how it works how to fulfill your specific request they type in how to get transcripts from youtube and here it is that\\'s how you do it it\\'s free no strings attached come and get it and so you get this traffic and and then you find a way on how to convert.  And basically the way to convert is, is give them this product, this tool, script directly in the dashboard so that they got they found themselves in the dashboard and I see they see the capabilities okay here we can add new more youtube videos and then search uh and then search this youtube videos create another content from this youtube videos or we can download extension and at calls for meetings there or whatever um so i\\'ll probably go for this multi-step  Maybe it\\'s  so overcomplicated for probably but better take some straightforward steps first like I I see what you mean though  and I think that it can it can be a uma introdução para um caminho em frente, eu posso pensar sobre isso.  Se você tem alguma outra ideia também, em termos do briefing, porque isso é realmente about tactic from when we first started working together.  I researched them, I researched the competitors, but then the other day I needed a transcript from YouTube and I stumbled upon that.  So, yeah.\\n- [37:07] This chunk is part of a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and Lara Vargas discussing strategies for content creation and influencer marketing for VEXA. They explore the effectiveness of leveraging influencers with established audiences versus creating original content based on user search behavior, emphasizing the importance of understanding audience needs and preferences in their marketing approach.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  the state world for we just just to create the content about about the exa but we don\\'t actually know uh if that would work right uh we know that if we we have an influencer with their own established audience that this audience will get in touch with the content created by this influencer.  That\\'s what we know. If we create our own content, but we don\\'t know if it will resonate at any way uh to make life easier better do um to start from what people search and create content for what people search around the problem area we are we attacked yeah i think that  Eu acho que isso pode ser feito. Eu acho que, por exemplo, uma coisa que eu vi é que muitas vezes o tipo de influencer que There is a type of influencer that is tips and tricks influencer.  So this type of influencer, lots of times they are not directly where your consumer is, but that specific video will go to your consumers for you page. Because the the content of it has to do with what they want in that specific context of the tips and tricks, so yeah, I think that this is something that I researched some of them, they were just a bit outside.  of the target that we were looking for that time, but I can reach out to them again and see.  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay, so basically I see a tool, first of all.  If you want to create content, then start with the content.  research, with the research of what people are actually looking for. Otherwise, if we integration that we can just say here is the product you know your audience you you know what you want to deliver to your audience what do you like what they\\'re expecting from you, you know much better how to present it.  These two ways, both would work, I believe.  At least for now we know that one of these things works.\\n- [39:51] This chunk occurs towards the end of a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and Lara Vargas, where they discuss scheduling a follow-up meeting, the use of Google Meet for calls, and issues related to user access and premium subscriptions for the VEXA platform.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  Okay, Laura, I think we can have another meeting next week.  Okay.  Just...  Just think about it.  Yeah, I will.

Eu vou falar com ele hoje no fim de tarde.  Eu sei que é muito bom esse tipo de serviço, porque quando eu trabalhava lá no escritório de empreendimentos, tinha um cara que atendia a gente, ele era marido dela e ela.  escritórios, essas empresas precisam arrumar uma torneira, arrumar sei lá, prender uma câmera, prender uma televisão é, exatamente  e deixa a hora assim sempre no particular ainda dá muito dinheiro para ele vale a pena ele é certo  Beleza então Doutor Nicolas eu vou eu vou dar uma checada já hoje ali nas campanhas tava rodando também Nessa conta.

A gente tem criado as campanhas lá, desde esse daí.  o mas agora que voltou já já vou dar uma olhadinha coloquei como prioridade aqui para mexer e vou eu vou testar o vídeo não tem jeito vou ter que testar o vídeo lá é o é uma forma da gente rodar Criativos novos ali, vê se dá uma boa.  Mas a gente tenta, esperando elas aprovarem um criativo lá, que a gente fez com o resto de foto que elas tinham, mas a gente vai amanhã, eu não vou, mas vai o fotógrafo fazer foto.  vamos ver se amanhã se mobilizam quanto antes a gente já sabe alguns se você tiver alguma noção de qual tipo, esse é o momento que brilha o olho o que você quiser tirar em foto e tal para me falar que eu peço fotógrafo e tiro amanhã, do jeito que vocês quiserem.  E isso eles vão na loja, no caso?  Eles vão, porque elas têm um escritório lá,  elas não têm tipo loja com móveis lá, mas eles vão no escritório delas, que é no Algo Verde lá.  Contar os quatro, são três mulheres e um cara só.  E todos os arquitetos.  E daí ele vai lá e vai tirar as fotos profissionais de todos eles, juntos ou não, enfim e tal.  Aí dá para pensar, por exemplo, uma foto da equipe toda.  Falando da história da Hound, uma equipe só, uma foto só com alguns deles, tipo, conheçam os profissionais, ou a equipe Hound, ou sei lá, ou...  O que a gente precisa, é que, Nicolas, te falando bem, é verdade, assim, a pessoa que tá buscando, tipo, um arquiteto...  projeto por eu só quero saber do projeto assim não me importa muito a equipe eu só quero tipo tudo bem quero saber a história de um criativo falando a história mas daí vou rodar para mas se eu quero contratar um serviço se eu quero entrar em contato com eles, tem que ser projeto pedir tudo que eles tiverem de vídeo de transformação é o que chama atenção não tem jeito  Eu vou pedir tudo o que tiver lá, mas os deles vão subindo também, beleza.  Daí, assim que colocarem no Drive, eu até vou ver se eles colocaram alguma coisa, então eu te dou um toque.  O deles era isso, eu preciso só montar o reporteio lá ainda.  Ok.

O que você quer, mãe?\\n\\n## Meeting 9 - December 05, 2024 13:59\\n\\n- [09:07] This chunk occurs during a conversation between Sunny Wyrzykowski and Dmitry Grankin, where they discuss Dmitry\\'s current marketing efforts and strategies for acquiring new clients for his product. Sunny inquires about the effectiveness of outreach methods beyond word of mouth, leading to a discussion about their experiences with platforms like Product Hunt, LinkedIn, and influencer marketing in Brazil.\\n  > Sunny Wyrzykowski:  Have you tried to, I know you mentioned that you right now, it\\'s mostly just word of mouth.  Have you tried?  to you know do some outreach or other kind of ways of of getting more clients or have you  just kind of focused on word of mouth for now yeah but we\\'ve tried product product hunt we\\'ve been semi-active on linkedin basically responding to incoming outreach doing some outbound outreach just just little bit uh we tried um we\\'ve dry we\\'ve tried influencer uh integration with the with it with micro influencer in Brazil and that was quite successful nice well it looks like we are getting those users as a result of that activity  activity now from brazilians from brazil uh-huh so when you mentioned you\\'ve tried you know like linkedin a little bit of linkedin outreach and stuff like that has that worked out pretty well for you or um how has that kind of worked out so far  um you know it\\'s a kind of natural uh natural behavior to to communicate with people that are willing to communicate with you and there\\'s nothing really and no deliberate action taken about that and on those things we tried as a deliberate action didn\\'t work that well maybe because It wasn\\'t done in the right way, like automated outreach that looked pretty silly to be honest with you.  Mm-hmm.\\n- [24:26] This chunk occurs during a conversation between Dmitry Grankin and Sunny Wyrzykowski, where Dmitry discusses the advantages of his product, Vexa, in comparison to another product, Fathom. He highlights Vexa\\'s unique features, such as its silent operation during calls and multilingual capabilities, while also emphasizing its ability to build collective knowledge from meetings. This discussion is part of a broader dialogue about business strategies and user acquisition.\\n  > Dmitry Grankin:  Okay, so you are absolutely happy about this product nothing really bothers you okay cool that\\'s one of a few products with which i i hear i hear that okay great i i encourage you to to try out vexa because um this what are the competitive advantage on which people are telling me not what I am telling people, but my users are telling, is that it stays silent on the call, doesn\\'t participate.  As a meeting participant, there\\'s some...  noise people i don\\'t know why actually but as a matter of fact and as i mentioned earlier it\\'s multilingual and it\\'s seamlessly um switching from one language to another and as what I\\'m telling the users you know they are telling me is that we are building knowledge with that so we can research not just a specific meeting after a call, but we can actually ask general questions about who are our competitors, what users say about us.  what we\\'ve been doing the last two weeks and yeah creating reports that are derived from the full body of uh collective knowledge how how does it uh how does it sounds to you\\n- [25:39] This chunk occurs towards the end of a conversation between Sunny Wyrzykowski, Dmitry Grankin, and Nora Köppling, where they discuss Dmitry\\'s product, VXR, and its features. Nora expresses interest in the product and mentions that it is currently free, while also inviting Dmitry to reach out in the future for consulting services if needed.\\n  > Nora Köppling:  yeah sounds good i mean yeah now we look into it and i mean we now have your your information and i also took a look at your website so yeah maybe okay cool  now it\\'s completely free just because i haven\\'t implemented payment and i\\'m  most interested about about the team use not about him so that so that\\'s why I\\'d  be really interested if you try it out yeah certainly thank you very much for  kind of showing that to us and of course if yeah this type of consulting is something  that\\'s also interesting for you in the future then also yeah feel free to reach out to us at any time  and we have our contact information and then we can yeah  this conversation we had today maybe in a few months um or whenever you\\'re ready for that\\n',\n",
