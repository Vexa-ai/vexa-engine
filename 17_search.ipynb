So these kinds of problems.  So they are actually writing topics, covering those problems and giving their product The solution, so that when someone comes and reads that content piece, first of all, they'll find the solution to the problem and then they will naturally see that, okay, VEXA AI actually solved my problem, okay, let me try it out.  So it will be acting as a natural lead magnet for you, right?  So it's a long-term thing.  You definitely need to work on that as your competitors are also doing.  And if you don't go towards SEO and you just focus on Captera, GE2 or PPC or influencer marketer, obviously you'll get quick results, you will get short term results, you will get short term leads, but in the longer run, And whenever you stop paying them, your traffic would fall down and you'll not be having a steady inflow of users onto your website.  So cutting it short, it should be a very balanced approach where you should focus on SEO as well as you should build a short-term strategy, let it be PPC, let it be influencer marketing, let it be other platforms like G2 Capital. So I'm not saying don't go that way.  But it has to be a balanced approach.  So you take both of these side by side so that one chunking is going toward a short-term goal and then one chunk is going towards a long-term plan.\",\n",

And basically the way to convert is, is give them this product, this tool, script directly in the dashboard so that they got they found themselves in the dashboard and I see they see the capabilities okay here we can add new more youtube videos and then search uh and then search this youtube videos create another content from this youtube videos or we can download extension and at calls for meetings there or whatever um so i'll probably go for this multi-step  Maybe it's  so overcomplicated for probably but better take some straightforward steps first like I I see what you mean though  and I think that it can it can be a uma introdução para um caminho em frente, eu posso pensar sobre isso.

So the best SEO that you could do is on your own website.  So people who are searching for AI automation platform or AI assistant platform, they should see your website.  That's the best thing that you could do with your platform.  And it's a long process.  It's not something that's going to happen in a month or in a quarter or in six months.  It's a long run and it's a long process that you have to work on.  That's something that should be done from the very start.  So as you know, you are actually launching your product, you are beta testing it right now.  People are getting traction and obviously from product and we can see that people are actually giving good reviews about the product.  So that actually shows that your market fit right now.  So once you go towards the launch, you should actually start working on your SEO and SEO should be focused towards your content marketing.  your blog section.  So what I have to say about your SEO, I mean, the main reason I reached out to you as well was, if you have seen your main competitors like Otter or Five Flies, Just I would like to know, do you consider Otter or Firefly as your competitor, or do you have some other competitors that you think are more relevant, if you can name them to me?  Yeah, we've got Otter, Firefly, We've got Fathom, we've got ETLGB, and these are the main competitors.  Okay, so while doing my head  I went on to Fireflies and Autumn.  So if you actually go onto the website and you did a little exploration on the website, you will see that both of them have a specific blog section on your website. And if you actually go a little bit deeper and see what type of content they're actually writing on the website. So that's not just an informational content that they write, their main goal and their main purpose.  was for having a block section is to address the queries and address the problem their users are having so that they can actually convert and start using the product, right?  So we call it as a product led SEO.  SEO so that focuses on writing content for the users who are actually looking for the product who are having a problem in actually getting transcriptions or recording of the meeting or AI based speech recognition and the transcription of the meeting notes.  So these kinds of problems.  So they are actually writing topics, covering those problems and giving their product The solution, so that when someone comes and reads that content piece, first of all, they'll find the solution to the problem and then they will naturally see that, okay, VEXA AI actually solved my problem, okay, let me try it out.\",\n",
