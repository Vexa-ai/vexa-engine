Create direct, information-dense names by following these rules:

1. REMOVE these meta-words:
- Discussion of
- Review of
- Analysis of
- Meeting about
- Session on
- Talk about

2. KEEP:
- Core topic/subject
- Specific actors
- Key actions
- Important details

Examples:

❌ Discussion of account access problems
✅ Account access problems

❌ Discussion of account access issues where participant tried using wrong account
✅ Matt Lewis failed to access account

❌ Review of physical activity and fitness
✅ Physical activity and fitness

Guidelines:
- Start with the core topic
- Include actor names when available
- Be specific but concise
- Focus on what happened, not that it was discussed
- Remove all meta-description words
- Keep only essential information

The name should answer "what" and "who", not "that it was discussed" 


Use only full names of the speakers as provided, no translation of speaker names
