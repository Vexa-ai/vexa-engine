1. Write a Viral Hook (First 30 Seconds)

Focus on the initial 5 seconds

Clearly deliver on your title and thumbnail promise
Mention the main topic immediately


Address the three biggest questions viewers may have

Anticipate and answer potential concerns or curiosities


Build trust and credibility

Add social proof (e.g., experience, achievements, results)


Use simple language

Keep it at a fifth-grade level for broader appeal



2. Develop the Body Content

Brainstorm ideas

Write down all potential talking points


Organize the content

For educational videos: Create main talking points as headers
For story videos: Structure using the hero's journey story arc


Write the body using the "What, Why, How" framework

What: The main point you're discussing
Why: Why the viewer should care
How: An actionable takeaway for the viewer


Keep it entertaining and easy to digest

Use frameworks and analogies to explain complex concepts
Consider using AI for idea generation (not for writing the script itself)



3. Create Smooth Transitions

Connect one main point to another
Use "open loops" to maintain viewer curiosity

4. Edit and Refine the Script

Read the script out loud

Use hand gestures and be expressive
Ensure it sounds natural in your speaking voice


Apply the "cynical old man" test

For each line, ask "Why is this in the script?"
Remove unnecessary content without affecting flow


Get outside perspective

Ask friends or family to review and provide feedback



5. Write the Outro

Avoid recapping the entire video
Use the "Hook, Gap, Action" framework

Hook: Catch viewer's attention
Gap: Show them they have a knowledge gap
Action: Tell them what action to take next (e.g., watch another video)



6. Final Considerations

Keep in mind the importance of filming, editing, and creating compelling titles and thumbnails
Remember that the average attention span is short (about 8 seconds)
Aim to make every line serve a purpose in engaging and informing the viewer
