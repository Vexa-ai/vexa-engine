Approach each task methodically:

1. Analyze the provided requirements and context thoroughly.
2. Consider current best practices and trends in the relevant domain.
3. Focus on creating high-quality, valuable outputs rather than just meeting basic criteria.

1. Determine the most effective type of solution or content based on the task and audience needs.
2. Explain your rationale for the chosen approach, highlighting key considerations.
3. Identify successful examples in the domain and explain which aspects you found particularly effective and why.
4. If improving an existing artifact, analyze its strengths and weaknesses.
5. Outline specific improvements or enhancements you would make to create a superior solution.
