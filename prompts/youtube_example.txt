                  I've helped the top YouTube creators amass hundreds of thousands of views with my viral video scripts in this video I'm going to review the step-by-step Frameworks that I've used to write video scripts in the shortest amount of time that will blow up your channel and make your audience fall in love with you and these Frameworks work for just about any Niche over the past 20 years the average attention span has dropped from 12 minutes to just 8 seconds less than a literal goldfish and that means you have just a few seconds

                  to grab your audience's attention before they click off and for YouTube videos the biggest drop off is in the first 30 seconds which means that without writing a solid hook you have literally zero chance of going viral here's how to write a viral hook in three simple steps first you want to pay particular attention to the initial 5 Seconds of the script Mr B says this all the time I bro I roast the hell out of people who like have boring first 5 seconds it's brutal so unless you want to get roasted

                  by Mr Beast make it clear that you will actually deliver on your title and thumbnail if your video is what writing viral hooks mention it in the first line I've helped the top YouTube creators amass hundreds of thousands of views with my viral video scripts next you want to list out the three biggest questions that the viewer will have when they see the title and thumbnail for example when you saw this video on the homepage you may have thought how do I know this will work will this work in any Niche and how long will it take for

                  me to write a viral script and I just answered them in this video I'm going to review the step-by-step Frameworks that I've used to write video scripts in the shortest amount of time that will blow up your channel and make your audience fall in love with you and these Frameworks work for just about any Niche every single line in the hook should have a purpose if it doesn't answer a question in the viewer's mind you can probably cut it and that includes telling the viewer to like And subscribe

                  at the start of the video it's kind of like asking a girl to be a girlfriend within the first 30 seconds of meeting her kind of awkward you can also take this chance to build trust and credibility with your Audience by adding social proof this could be by talking about how much money you're making how big your YouTube channel is or how many years of experience you have doing what you do lastly keep the language below a fifth grade level you want your video to attract as many people as possible so you want to use simpler language to

                  Target Target a larger audience imagine if we started with in this video we will unravel the Arcane Artistry behind YouTube script writing doesn't feel right in the next step we are writing the body section this is the meat and potatoes of the content and if you presented your content in an informative and entertaining way your viewers would have learned something new and watched till the very end so your video will get hundreds and thousands of views we first want to take out a pen and vomit everything that we want to talk about
              
                  02:24
                  onto a piece of paper don't worry if it's disorganized because the next step we will organize the brain dump into the main talking points of the video for educational videos you can write out each point as a hitter for example this is the outline of this script for Story videos we can structure the video using the heroes Journey story arc where the main character starts off in the Ordinary World goes on an adventure meets a talking donkey faces a few challenges fights off a dragon eventually wins returns back home safely
              
                  02:50
                  and everyone lives happily ever after every good story has a hero's journey in it including some of your favorite movies now that we have to outline we can move on to the body this is by far the the most difficult part in the script writing process just because it takes so much time most people end up procrastinating for days and even weeks and they end up releasing their video late and when they do decide to ride it they end up Rambling On and On just saying random words into the camera with no clear structure and it just turns out

                  a total mess to save you some pain you can use the what why how framework when writing what being the main point you're actually talking about why being why the viewer should care how being an actionable takeaway for the viewer you want to keep it entertaining and easy to digest one way you can do that is by using Frameworks and analogies to explain complex Concepts to the viewer also if at any point you're stuck you can also use AI in the script writing process and no I'm not saying to use AI to help you write the script itself the
              
                  03:42
                  scripts they give are pretty bad because AI doesn't understand what kind of content works on YouTube but you can use Chad to come up with new ideas to overcome writer's block just like how I asked it what to write about in the next section and it told me transitions transitions will help you connect one main point to another without the video feeling disjointed you can also take this chance to create what I call an open loop which will Peak the viewers curiosity and keep them watching one way that you can introduce the next section

                  after you've completed a point is by saying now that we've written the transition we can now move on to the most overlooked yet most important step which is also the transition here look the first draw of your script will be far from perfect so you will have to edit it multiple times in fact I spent 5 hours editing the script down from its original 16 minute length if you skip the step the filming and editing process will take longer than expected because of all of the errors that you have to cut out out you want to refine the
              
                  04:31
                  structure make sure that the transitions are smooth from one section to another and check if the pacing is engaging when you are editing the script don't stare into your screen like a zombie read the script out loud use hand gestures and be expressive so you know what the script sounds like in your speaking voice that way you know whether the words actually sound good coming out of your mouth another great editing tip is to imagine a cynical old man sitting right beside you as you are reading the script and

                  with each line he reads he asks you why is this line in the script if you don't have a good answer and you can remove move it without affecting the flow of the video you can probably cut it in most cases less is more if you've got time you can ask friends and family to read your script and point out any errors an outside perspective usually sees more the very last step is writing the outro a common mistake I see many creators make is recapping everything that they've just talked about in the video kind of like in this video we
              
                  05:19
                  talked about how to write a hook how to write a body how to write a call to action how to this how to that don't recapping the video ruins your retention instead you want to do a simple call to action to another video on your Channel you can use the hook Gap action framework where you catch the viewers attention show them that they have a knowledge Gap and tell them what action to take next congratulations now you know how to write a viral video script but there's something I didn't tell you guys everything I've just said in this

                  video is completely useless if you don't know how to film edit or create a killer title and thumbnail that's why I created a video explaining just that you can click on the video over here go and watch that I'll see you in the next one
